All	O

that	O

We	O
know	O

stated	O

indeed	O
,	O
including	O
specifically	O
during	O
the	O
last	O
plenary	O

of	O
last	O
year	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
solely	O
a	O
legal	O
case	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
wrong	O
for	O
Alexander	B-PER

to	O
be	O
accused	O

the	O
Barents	B-LOC

and	O
that	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
would	O
ask	O
you	O
to	O
examine	O
a	O

setting	O
out	O
the	O
most	O

Parliament	B-ORG

position	O

as	O
expressed	O
in	O
the	O

it	O

as	O
Russia	B-LOC

Yes	O
,	O
Mrs	O
Schroedter	B-PER
,	O
I	O
shall	O
be	O
pleased	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
the	O

when	O
I	O
have	O
received	O
your	O
letter	O

Madam	O
President	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
firstly	O
like	O
to	O
compliment	O
you	O
on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
kept	O
your	O
word	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
during	O
this	O
first	O
part-session	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
year	O
,	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
television	O
channels	O
in	O
our	O
offices	O
has	O
indeed	O
increased	O
considerably	O

But	O
,	O
Madam	O
President	O
,	O
my	O
personal	O
request	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
met	O
.	O

Although	O
there	O
are	O
now	O
two	O
Finnish	B-MISC
channels	O
and	O
one	O
Portuguese	B-MISC
one	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
still	O
no	O
Dutch	B-MISC
channel	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
requested	O
because	O
Dutch	B-MISC
people	O
here	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
follow	O
the	O
news	O
too	O
when	O
we	O
are	O
sent	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
of	O
exile	O
every	O
month	O

I	O
would	O
therefore	O
once	O
more	O
ask	O
you	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
we	O
get	O
a	O
Dutch	B-MISC
channel	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

Mrs	O
Plooij-van	B-PER
Gorsel	I-PER
,	O
I	O
can	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
this	O
matter	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
agenda	O
for	O
the	O
Quaestors	O
'	O
meeting	O
on	O
Wednesday	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
,	O
I	O
hope	O
,	O
be	O
examined	O
in	O
a	O
positive	O
light	O
.	O

Madam	O
President	O
,	O
can	O
you	O
tell	O
me	O
why	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
does	O
not	O
adhere	O
to	O
the	O
health	O
and	O
safety	O
legislation	O
that	O
it	O
actually	O
passes	O
?	O

Why	O
has	O
no	O
air	O
quality	O
test	O
been	O
done	O
on	O
this	O
particular	O
building	O
since	O
we	O
were	O
elected	O
?	O

Why	O
has	O
there	O
been	O
no	O
Health	B-ORG
and	I-ORG
Safety	I-ORG
Committee	I-ORG
meeting	O
since	O
1998	O
?	O

Why	O
has	O
there	O
been	O
no	O
fire	O
drill	O
,	O
either	O
in	O
the	O
Brussels	B-LOC
Parliament	I-LOC

the	O
Strasbourg	B-LOC
Parliament	I-LOC

Why	O
are	O
there	O
no	O
fire	O

?	O

Why	O
have	O
the	O
staircases	O
not	O
been	O
improved	O
since	O
my	O
accident	O
?	O

Why	O
are	O
no-smoking	O
areas	O
not	O
enforced	O
?	O

It	O
seems	O
absolutely	O
disgraceful	O
that	O
we	O
pass	O
legislation	O
and	O
do	O
not	O
adhere	O
to	O
it	O
ourselves	O
.	O

Mrs	O
Lynne	B-PER
,	O
you	O
are	O
quite	O
right	O
and	O
I	O
shall	O
check	O
whether	O
this	O
has	O
actually	O
not	O
been	O
done	O

I	O
shall	O
also	O
refer	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
the	O
College	B-ORG

and	O
I	O
am	O
certain	O
that	O
they	O

Madam	O
President	O
,	O
Mrs	O
Díez	B-PER
González	I-PER
and	O
I	O
had	O
tabled	O
questions	O
on	O
certain	O
opinions	O
of	O
the	O
Vice-President	O

Mrs	O
de	B-PER
Palacio	I-PER
,	O
which	O
appeared	O
in	O
a	O
Spanish	B-MISC

The	O
competent	O
services	O
have	O
not	O
included	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
agenda	O
on	O
the	O
grounds	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
answered	O
in	O
a	O
previous	O
part-session	O

I	O
would	O
ask	O
that	O
they	O
reconsider	O

since	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
case	O

The	O
questions	O

ABC	B-MISC

on	O
18	O
November	O

Mr	O
Berenguer	B-PER
Fuster	I-PER
,	O
we	O
shall	O
check	O
all	O
this	O
.	O

I	O
admit	O
that	O
,	O
at	O
present	O
,	O
the	O
matter	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
somewhat	O
confused	O
.	O

We	O
shall	O
therefore	O
look	O
into	O
it	O
properly	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
everything	O
is	O
as	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
.	O

Madam	O
President	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
clear	O
message	O
going	O
out	O
from	O
Parliament	B-ORG
this	O
week	O
about	O
our	O
discontent	O
over	O
today	O
's	O
decision	O
refusing	O
to	O
renew	O
the	O
arms	O
embargo	O
on	O
Indonesia	B-LOC
,	O
considering	O
that	O
the	O
vast	O
majority	O
in	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
have	O
endorsed	O
the	O
arms	O
embargo	O
in	O
Indonesia	B-LOC
in	O
the	O
past	O
?	O

Today	O
's	O
decision	O
not	O
to	O
renew	O
the	O
embargo	O
is	O
extremely	O
dangerous	O
considering	O
the	O
situation	O
there	O
.	O

So	O
Parliament	B-ORG
should	O
send	O
a	O
message	O
,	O
since	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
wish	O
of	O
the	O
vast	O
majority	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
irresponsible	O
of	O
EU	B-ORG
Member	I-ORG
States	I-ORG
to	O
refuse	O
to	O
renew	O
the	O
embargo	O

In	O
any	O
event	O

this	O
question	O
is	O
not	O

Agenda	O

Madam	O
President	O
,	O
the	O
presentation	O
of	O
the	O
Prodi	B-ORG
Commission	I-ORG
'	O
s	O
political	O
programme	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
legislature	O
was	O
initially	O
a	O
proposal	O
by	O
the	O
Group	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
the	I-ORG
Party	I-ORG
of	I-ORG
European	I-ORG
Socialists	I-ORG
which	O
was	O
unanimously	O
approved	O
by	O
the	O
Conference	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
Presidents	I-ORG
in	O
September	O
and	O
which	O
was	O
also	O
explicitly	O
accepted	O
by	O
President	O
Prodi	B-PER
,	O
who	O
reiterated	O
his	O
commitment	O
in	O
his	O
inaugural	O
speech	O
.	O

This	O
commitment	O
is	O
important	O
because	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
is	O
a	O
body	O
with	O
a	O
monopoly	O
of	O
initiative	O
in	O
accordance	O
with	O
the	O
Treaties	B-MISC
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
basically	O
dictates	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
'	O
s	O
political	O
and	O
legislative	O
activity	O
for	O
the	O
next	O
five	O
years	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
also	O
like	O
to	O
point	O
out	O
,	O
Madam	O
President	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
voted	O
to	O
express	O
its	O
confidence	O
in	O
President	O
Prodi	B-PER
during	O
the	O
previous	O
legislature	O
.	O
It	O
did	O
so	O
again	O
during	O
this	O
legislature	O
,	O
in	O
July	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
in	O
September	O
,	O
it	O
voted	O
once	O
more	O
to	O
approve	O
the	O
whole	O
Commission	B-ORG
.	O

There	O
has	O
therefore	O
been	O
enough	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
prepare	O
its	O
programme	O
and	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
become	O
familiar	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
explain	O
it	O
to	O
our	O
citizens	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
end	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
remind	O
you	O
of	O
the	O
resolution	O
of	O
15	O
September	O
,	O
which	O
recommended	O
that	O
the	O
proposal	O
be	O
presented	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

The	O
events	O
of	O
last	O
week	O
-	O
which	O
originated	O
outside	O
the	O
Conference	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
Presidents	I-ORG
,	O
that	O
Conference	O
being	O
used	O
simply	O
to	O
corroborate	O
and	O
ratify	O
decisions	O
taken	O
elsewhere	O
-	O
present	O
us	O
with	O
a	O
dilemma	O
.	O
Either	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
is	O
not	O
ready	O
to	O
present	O
this	O
programme	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
it	O
should	O
clarify	O
it	O
.	O

According	O
to	O
its	O
President	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

Given	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
is	O
represented	O
by	O
Vice-President	O
de	B-PER
Palacio	I-PER
,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
,	O
before	O
voting	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
help	O
if	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG

the	O

our	O
answer	O
to	O

of	O
this	O

this	O

an	O

step	O
towards	O
well-trained	O

being	O
available	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
right	O

content	O
ourselves	O
with	O
enacting	O
European	B-MISC
law	I-MISC
to	O
ensure	O

We	O
also	O
need	O
to	O

that	O

we	O

Please	O
let	O
this	O
not	O

another	O

have	O
to	O
lament	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O

In	O
this	O
context	O

I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
request	O

ask	O
the	O
Commissioner	O

who	O

to	O

it	O
safer	O

so	O
that	O
we	O

do	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
experience	O
any	O
more	O
such	O
disasters	O
on	O
this	O

I	O
congratulate	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
excellent	O
report	O

The	O
rapporteur	O
has	O
pointed	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
House	O
that	O
in	O
its	O
common	O
position	O
the	O
Council	B-ORG
has	O
accepted	O
six	O
of	O
Parliament	B-ORG
's	O
ten	O
amendments	O
put	O
forward	O
at	O
first	O
reading	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
substance	O
of	O
Parliament	B-ORG
's	O
other	O
amendments	O
has	O
been	O
retained	O
.	O

My	O
Group	O
will	O
therefore	O
support	O
the	O
common	O
position	O
and	O
looks	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
enactment	O
of	O
the	O
legislation	O
which	O
will	O
provide	O
us	O
with	O
yet	O
another	O
tool	O
in	O
our	O
fight	O
to	O
make	O
transport	O
in	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
as	O
safe	O
as	O
possible	O

When	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O

my	O

will	O
always	O
support	O
any	O
initiatives	O
to	O
improve	O

We	O
still	O
have	O
a	O

of	O
work	O
to	O

in	O
this	O

Madam	O
President	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
few	O
comments	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
,	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
to	O
thank	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
for	O
his	O
exceptionally	O
accurate	O
and	O
technical	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
report	O
and	O
,	O
secondly	O
,	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
for	O
the	O
proposal	O
it	O
has	O
submitted	O
.	O

Needless	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
safety	O
on	O
roads	O
,	O
railways	O
and	O
inland	O
waterways	O
is	O
of	O
key	O
importance	O
and	O
,	O
given	O
the	O
international	O
nature	O
of	O
these	O
types	O
of	O
transport	O
,	O
training	O
for	O
safety	O
advisors	O
should	O
also	O
be	O
harmonised	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
requirements	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
ADR	B-MISC
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
under	O
way	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
important	O
,	O
but	O
so	O
is	O
enforcement	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
reasons	O
why	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
pay	O
particular	O
attention	O
to	O
this	O
.	O

Just	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
road	O
accidents	O
which	O
have	O
occurred	O
over	O
recent	O
years	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
in	O
Belgium	B-LOC
,	O
the	B-LOC
Netherlands	I-LOC
and	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
other	O
countries	O
where	O
lorries	O
carrying	O
dangerous	O
goods	O
continued	O
to	O
drive	O
in	O
foggy	O
conditions	O
when	O
really	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
pulled	O
off	O
the	O
road	O
instead	O
.	O

Or	O
ships	O
from	O
Eastern	B-LOC
Europe	I-LOC
which	O
moor	O
adjacent	O
to	O
ships	O
over	O
here	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
obvious	O
risks	O
that	O
this	O
entails	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
transpired	O
that	O
research	O
in	O
the	O
ports	O
in	O
Belgium	B-LOC
,	O
Finland	B-LOC
,	O
but	O
also	O
in	O
Japan	B-LOC
has	O
shown	O
that	O
50	O
%	O
of	O
containers	O
with	O
partially	O
dangerous	O
cargo	O
are	O
not	O
delivered	O
correctly	O
for	O
shipment	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
the	O
issue	O
is	O
an	O
important	O
one	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
situation	O
where	O
safety	O
advisers	O
are	O
concerned	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
countries	O
it	O
is	O
compulsory	O
to	O
employ	O
such	O
safety	O
advisers	O
in	O
companies	O
as	O
from	O
1	O
January	O
of	O
this	O
year	O
.	O

There	O
will	O
be	O
major	O
problems	O
with	O
enforcing	O
this	O
rule	O
at	O
present	O
,	O
especially	O
with	O
smaller	O
companies	O
,	O
as	O
these	O
cannot	O
afford	O
safety	O
advisors	O
.	O

These	O
smaller	O
companies	O
either	O
dispose	O
of	O
their	O
cargo	O
or	O
mix	O
it	O
with	O
other	O
cargo	O
,	O
which	O
causes	O
problems	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
therefore	O
also	O
being	O
requested	O
that	O
ISO	B-MISC
9002	I-MISC
certificates	O
possibly	O
include	O
the	O
finer	O
details	O
of	O
these	O
activities	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
annual	O
reports	O
and	O
company	O
analyses	O
.	O

The	O
work	O
is	O
done	O
.	O
All	O
that	O
remains	O
is	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
enforcement	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
mention	O
one	O
final	O
point	O
.	O

With	O
regard	O
to	O
enforcement	O
,	O
proper	O
agreements	O
must	O
also	O
be	O
concluded	O
with	O
the	O
Eastern	B-MISC
European	I-MISC
countries	O
because	O
they	O
will	O
not	O
enter	O
into	O
treaties	O
which	O
deal	O
with	O
this	O
matter	O
until	O
1	O
July	O
2001	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
in	O
eighteen	O
months	O
'	O
time	O
.	O

This	O
gives	O
them	O
a	O
competitive	O
edge	O
for	O
the	O
interim	O
period	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
itself	O
anything	O
dreadful	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
prioritise	O
particularly	O
the	O
safety	O
aspects	O
for	O
goods	O
transported	O
by	O
road	O
,	O
rail	O
and	O
inland	O
waterways	O
and	O
incorporate	O
these	O
,	O
as	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
acquis	B-MISC
communautaire	I-MISC
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
and	O
present	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
acceding	O
states	O
.	O

Madam	O
President	O
,	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
transport	O
safety	O
is	O
highlighted	O
on	O
a	O
regular	O
basis	O
in	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
and	O
rightly	O
so	O
.	O

The	O
ever	O
increasing	O
volume	O
of	O
goods	O
passing	O
through	O
Europe	B-LOC
entails	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
risks	O
,	O
known	O
and	O
unknown	O
,	O
for	O
employees	O
and	O
the	O
social	O
environment	O
.	O

Those	O
having	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
these	O
risks	O
should	O
therefore	O
meet	O
stringent	O
requirements	O
.	O

The	O
relevant	O
standards	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
another	O
Directive	O
,	O
95	B-MISC
/	I-MISC
35	I-MISC
/	I-MISC
EC	I-MISC
,	O
seem	O
sufficiently	O
adequate	O
to	O
advise	O
people	O
in	O
a	O
responsible	O
manner	O
on	O
the	O
organisation	O
of	O
the	O
transport	O
of	O
dangerous	O
goods	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
very	O
pleased	O
that	O
agreement	O
has	O
also	O
been	O
reached	O
with	O
the	O
Council	B-ORG
on	O
minimum	O
standards	O
regarding	O
examinations	O
,	O
although	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
preferred	O
it	O
if	O
uniform	O
,	O
set	O
standards	O
and	O
modules	O
had	O
been	O
established	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
certificates	O
would	O
be	O
of	O
equal	O
value	O
internationally	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
does	O
not	O
seem	O
feasible	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
the	O
amendment	O
tabled	O
by	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
is	O
perfectly	O
logical	O
and	O
I	O
can	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
give	O
it	O
my	O
wholehearted	O
support	O
.	O

Mr	O

,	O
though	O
technical	O
,	O
are	O
nonetheless	O
of	O
very	O
great	O
significance	O
for	O
safety	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
just	O
a	O
few	O
comments	O
.	O

Firstly	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O
Commissioner	O
-	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
convinced	O
that	O
my	O
request	O
will	O
fall	O
on	O
fertile	O
ground	O
-	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
more	O
attention	O
is	O
paid	O
to	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
safety	O
,	O
be	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
roads	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
waterways	O
or	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

Considering	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
only	O
today	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
dealing	O
with	O
a	O
Commission	B-ORG
proposal	O
first	O
made	O
on	O
19	O
March	O
1998	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
Parliament	B-ORG
responded	O
relatively	O
quickly	O
,	O
this	O
time	O
lag	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
long	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
not	O
just	O
the	O
fault	O
of	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
,	O
but	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
take	O
action	O
more	O
quickly	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
achieve	O
harmonisation	O
in	O
this	O
area	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

My	O
second	O
point	O
has	O
already	O
been	O
mentioned	O
:	O
it	O
concerns	O
the	O
minimum	O
standards	O
.	O

In	O
principle	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
in	O
many	O
cases	O
where	O
transport	O
is	O
concerned	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
working	O
towards	O
increased	O
flexibility	O
and	O
country-specific	O
rules	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
safety	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
rather	O
sceptical	O
because	O
safety	O
in	O
Sweden	B-LOC
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
is	O
in	O
principle	O
no	O
different	O
from	O
safety	O
in	O
Germany	B-LOC
,	O
Italy	B-LOC
or	O
Austria	B-LOC
.	O

I	O
can	O
live	O
with	O
these	O
minimum	O
standards	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
ask	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
monitor	O
the	O
situation	O
very	O
carefully	O
.	O

Should	O
flexibility	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
result	O
in	O
there	O
being	O
inadequate	O
rules	O
in	O
some	O
countries	O
then	O
we	O
should	O
work	O
towards	O
greater	O
harmonisation	O
.	O

We	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
conditions	O
of	O
competition	O
worse	O
for	O
some	O
countries	O
unilaterally	O
and	O
improve	O
them	O
for	O
countries	O
such	O
as	O
Austria	B-LOC
or	O
other	O
transit	O
countries	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
all	O
we	O
can	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
transport	O
of	O
dangerous	O
goods	O
to	O
a	O
minimum	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
countries	O
,	O
whether	O
they	O
are	O
transit	O
countries	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

We	O
understand	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
institutions	O
-	O
Parliament	B-ORG
and	O
Commission	B-ORG
-	O
cooperate	O
and	O
work	O
together	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
current	O
cooperation	O
with	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG
on	I-ORG
Regional	I-ORG
Policy	I-ORG
,	O
and	O
in	O
particular	O
the	O
transport	B-ORG
group	I-ORG
,	O
is	O
magnificent	O
.	O

The	O
common	O
position	O
includes	O
practically	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
amendments	O
accepted	O
by	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
and	O
harmonises	O
the	O
minimum	O
examination	O
requirements	O
for	O
safety	O
advisers	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
second	O
reading	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
accept	O
the	O
amendment	O
on	O
the	O
proposed	O
date	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
much	O
more	O
realistic	O
than	O
the	O
one	O
originally	O
suggested	O
by	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
,	O
bearing	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
now	O
spent	O
several	O
years	O
debating	O
this	O
question	O
.	O

Very	O
briefly	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
thank	O
the	O
various	O
Members	O
for	O
their	O
interventions	O
and	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
safety	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
'	O
s	O
priorities	O
in	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
transport	O
.	O

As	O
Mr	O
Simpson	B-PER
has	O
said	O
very	O
correctly	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
process	O
which	O
we	O
can	O
never	O
take	O
for	O
granted	O
or	O
regard	O
as	O
having	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
end	O
.	O

The	O
process	O
of	O
increasing	O
safety	O
margins	O
and	O
safety	O
guarantees	O
in	O
transport	O
is	O
a	O
process	O
which	O
must	O
be	O
improved	O
day	O
by	O
day	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
regard	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
also	O
like	O
to	O
refer	O
very	O
briefly	O
to	O
the	O
problems	O
of	O
the	O
tunnels	O
,	O
which	O
Messrs	O
Rack	B-PER
and	O
Swoboda	B-PER
have	O
referred	O
to	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
Austria	B-LOC
,	O
is	O
doubtless	O
a	O
very	O
sensitive	O
issue	O
,	O
and	O
great	O
effort	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
improve	O
their	O
safety	O
.	O

In	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O
accidents	O
to	O
have	O
occurred	O
recently	O
,	O
the	O
goods	O
being	O
transported	O
were	O
not	O
dangerous	O
in	O
themselves	O
.	O

Margarine	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
kilos	O
of	O
paint	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
principle	O
,	O
do	O
not	O
present	O
risks	O
,	O
led	O
to	O
a	O
genuine	O
disaster	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
requirements	O
guaranteeing	O
the	O
maximum	O
degree	O
of	O
safety	O
can	O
be	O
further	O
improved	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
consider	O
safety	O
in	O
all	O
types	O
of	O
transport	O
.	O

This	O
week	O
we	O
will	O
be	O
holding	O
a	O
debate	O
here	O
on	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
sea	O
transport	O
,	O
in	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
Erika	B-MISC
disaster	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
year	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
discuss	O
our	O
objectives	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
air	O
transport	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
safety	O
is	O
a	O
priority	O
objective	O
for	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
.	O

As	O
I	O
will	O
say	O
in	O
the	O
debate	O
on	O
the	O
Erika	B-MISC
disaster	O
,	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
wait	O
until	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
disaster	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
safety	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
work	O
on	O
it	O
even	O
when	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
such	O
circumstances	O
,	O
which	O
simply	O
serve	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
the	O
urgency	O
for	O
an	O
effective	O
response	O
to	O
this	O
type	O
of	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
repeat	O
my	O
appreciation	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
speakers	O
and	O
especially	O
to	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
,	O
Mr	O
Koch	B-PER
.	O

The	O
debate	O
is	O
closed	O

The	O
vote	O
will	O
take	O
place	O
tomorrow	O
at	O

p.m.	O

Transport	O

Delays	O
in	O
the	O
CEN	B-ORG
'	O
s	O
work	O
are	O
now	O
making	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
apply	O
this	O
very	O
directive	O
.	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
annexes	O
cannot	O
be	O
adapted	O
to	O
take	O
account	O
of	O
technical	O
and	O
industrial	O
developments	O
.	O

I	O
regret	O
this	O
since	O
we	O
are	O
having	O
to	O
take	O
action	O
because	O
others	O
have	O
not	O
done	O
their	O
job	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
respect	O
,	O
I	O
accept	O
this	O
proposal	O
to	O
amend	O
Directive	B-MISC
94	I-MISC
/	I-MISC
55	I-MISC
/	I-MISC
EC	I-MISC
which	O
has	O
been	O
tabled	O
for	O

today	O
.	O

Should	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
fail	O
to	O
take	O
action	O
,	O
then	O
Member	B-ORG
States	I-ORG
would	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
amend	O
their	O
national	O
legislation	O
for	O
a	O
very	O
brief	O
period	O
,	O
until	O
the	O
CEN	B-ORG
completes	O
its	O
work	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
cause	O
unnecessary	O
cost	O
and	O
uncertainty	O
.	O

The	O
amendment	O
to	O
the	O
directive	O
on	O
today	O
's	O
agenda	O
does	O
not	O
therefore	O
affect	O
the	O
existing	O
harmonisation	O
of	O
the	O
transport	O
of	O
dangerous	O
goods	O
in	O
the	O
Community	B-LOC
.	O

It	O
merely	O
prolongs	O
transitional	O
rules	O
by	O
postponing	O
deadlines	O
,	O
deletes	O
provisions	O
which	O
are	O
no	O
longer	O

for	O

The	O

to	O
the	O

is	O
consequently	O
in	O

therefore	O
take	O
account	O
of	O

Two	O
of	O
the	O

unanimously	O
by	O
the	O
committee	O
relate	O
precisely	O
to	O
this	O
amended	O
comitology	O
procedure	O

We	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
reference	O
to	O
this	O
as	O
early	O
as	O
the	O
recitals	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
period	O
within	O
which	O
the	O
Council	B-ORG
has	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
decision	O
-	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
clearly	O
worded	O

is	O
set	O
at	O
a	O
maximum	O

In	O
addition	O
,	O
the	O
need	O
for	O
greater	O
transparency	O
has	O
been	O
pointed	O
out	O
.	O

A	O
further	O
amendment	O
allows	O
the	O
Member	B-ORG
States	I-ORG
to	O
impose	O
more	O
stringent	O
requirements	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
for	O
vacuum	O
tanks	O
,	O
if	O
work	O
is	O
done	O

goods	O
are	O
transported	O
as	O
a	O
priority	O
in	O
temperatures	O
well	O
below	O

This	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
special	O
interest	O
of	O
northern	O
European	B-MISC
regions	O
.	O

A	O
final	O
amendment	O
is	O
intended	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
tanks	O
and	O
tankers	O
put	O
into	O
service	O
between	O
1	O
January	O
1997	O
and	O
the	O
entry	O
into	O
force	O
of	O
this	O

may	O
continue	O

provided	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
constructed	O

I	O
do	O

that	O
this	O

only	O
a	O
small	O

,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
Europe	B-LOC
must	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
be	O
confident	O
that	O
the	O
goods	O
-	O
however	O
dangerous	O
they	O
are	O
-	O
which	O
are	O
transported	O
on	O
Europe	B-LOC
's	O
roads	O
,	O
railways	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
are	O
as	O
safe	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

This	O
directive	O
is	O
a	O
contribution	O
to	O
this	O
.	O

What	O
we	O
are	O
doing	O
today	O
is	O
essentially	O
a	O
nuisance	O
.	O

The	O
rapporteur	O
,	O
Mr	O
Koch	B-PER
,	O
to	O
whom	O
we	O
express	O
our	O
thanks	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
which	O
he	O
has	O
done	O
on	O
this	O
,	O
has	O
already	O
pointed	O
out	O
that	O
basically	O
everything	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
somewhat	O
more	O
advanced	O
had	O
it	O
not	O
been	O
for	O
the	O
inactivity	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
CEN	B-ORG
,	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
dilatory	O
in	O
drawing	O
up	O
and	O
adapting	O
the	O
directive	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
can	O
only	O
hope	O
-	O
and	O
we	O
should	O
resolve	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
this	O
week	O
-	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
2001	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
finally	O
have	O
Community	B-ORG
regulations	O
for	O
the	O
transport	O
of	O
dangerous	O
goods	O
by	O
road	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O
legal	O
certainty	O
here	O
and	O
also	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
roads	O
are	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
safer	O
.	O

Very	O
large	O
quantities	O
of	O
dangerous	O
goods	O
are	O
transported	O
around	O
the	O
EU	B-ORG
,	O
both	O
on	O
roads	O
and	O
railways	O
and	O
by	O
sea	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
extraordinarily	O
positive	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
cause	O
to	O
thank	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
,	O
Mr	O
Koch	B-PER
,	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
he	O
has	O
put	O
in	O
on	O
this	O
issue	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
also	O
important	O
where	O
the	O
prerequisites	O
for	O
the	O
internal	O
market	O
are	O
concerned	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
common	O
transport	O
market	O
genuinely	O
up	O
and	O
running	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
only	O
have	O
regulations	O
but	O
that	O
these	O
regulations	O
should	O
also	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
apply	O
to	O
every	O
country	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
conclude	O
by	O
commenting	O
on	O
a	O
third	O
matter	O
which	O
is	O
also	O
of	O
significance	O
,	O
namely	O
an	O
amendment	O
tabled	O
by	O
Member	O
of	O
Parliament	B-ORG
,	O
Mr	O
Ari	B-PER
Vatanen	I-PER
.	O

In	O
many	O
ways	O
,	O
the	O
prerequisites	O
differ	O
from	O
one	O
Member	O
State	O
to	O
another	O
.	O

By	O
approving	O
this	O
amendment	O
,	O
we	O
take	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
cold	O
in	O
the	O
northern	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
.	O

This	O
makes	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
also	O
take	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
ways	O
in	O
which	O
materials	O
and	O
packaging	O
are	O
affected	O
by	O
cold	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
thank	O
not	O
only	O
Mr	O
Koch	B-PER
,	O
but	O
also	O
the	O
Vice-President	O
of	O
the	O
Commission	O
for	O
the	O
clear	O
and	O
unambiguous	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
declared	O
their	O
support	O
for	O
safety	O
in	O
the	O
transport	O
sector	O
and	O
acknowledged	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
priority	O
.	O

The	O
reason	O
Mr	O
Koch	B-PER
produced	O
his	O
sound	O
report	O
was	O
because	O
the	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
CEN	B-ORG
and	O
within	O
the	O
United	B-ORG
Nations	I-ORG
Economic	I-ORG
Commission	I-ORG
was	O
proceeding	O
none	O
too	O
expeditiously	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O
Vice-President	O
if	O
she	O
is	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
today	O
what	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
play	O
is	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
efforts	O
towards	O
harmonisation	O
being	O
made	O
by	O
these	O
two	O
organisations	O
,	O
and	O
whether	O
the	O
EU	B-ORG
is	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
to	O
hasten	O
these	O
harmonisation	O
efforts	O
,	O
in	O
accordance	O
with	O
principles	O
that	O
are	O
as	O
simple	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

For	O
one	O
thing	O
is	O
clear	O
:	O
even	O
if	O
we	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
excellent	O
arrangement	O
within	O
the	O
European	B-LOC
Union	I-LOC
,	O
traffic	O
does	O
not	O
stop	O
at	O
our	O
borders	O
,	O
it	O
goes	O
beyond	O
them	O
.	O

Hence	O
there	O
is	O
certainly	O
every	O
reason	O
to	O
introduce	O
more	O
far-reaching	O
regional	O
provisions	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
Commissioner	O
is	O
unable	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
today	O
then	O
would	O
she	O
be	O
prepared	O
to	O
inform	O
the	O
committee	O
in	O
writing	O
of	O
how	O
matters	O
stand	O
and	O
what	O
stage	O
negotiations	O
between	O
the	O
CEN	B-ORG
and	O
the	O
Economic	B-ORG
Commission	I-ORG
are	O
at	O
?	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
once	O
again	O
like	O
to	O
congratulate	O
Mr	O
Koch	B-PER
on	O
his	O
magnificent	O
work	O
on	O
this	O
other	O
report	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
supplements	O
the	O
debate	O
which	O
we	O
held	O
in	O
October	O
on	O
rail	O
transport	O
.	O

We	O
all	O
regret	O
that	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Committee	I-ORG
for	I-ORG
Standardisation	I-ORG
(	I-ORG
CEN	I-ORG
)	I-ORG
has	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
required	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
out	O
the	O
amendment	O
of	O
the	O
provisions	O
necessary	O
for	O
the	O
required	O
harmonisation	O
within	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
.	O

This	O
debate	O
and	O
the	O
amendment	O
of	O
the	O
directive	O
currently	O
in	O
force	O
allow	O
us	O
to	O
incorporate	O
differentiating	O
elements	O
which	O
demonstrate	O
the	O
diversity	O
of	O
this	O
Europe	B-LOC
of	O
ours	O
.	O

A	O
moment	O
ago	O
,	O
Mr	O
Vatanen	B-PER
spoke	O
to	O
us	O
of	O
lower	O
temperatures	O
,	O
not	O
of	O
20	O
degrees	O
below	O
zero	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
40	O
degrees	O
below	O
zero	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
we	O
accept	O
that	O
amendment	O
-	O
it	O
is	O
absolutely	O
right	O
-	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
incorporate	O
specific	O
circumstances	O
which	O
demonstrate	O
the	O
climatic	O
diversity	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
,	O
which	O
sometimes	O
take	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
specifics	O
and	O
of	O
concrete	O
requirements	O
for	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
standards	O
and	O
characterisations	O
of	O
a	O
technical	O
nature	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
Mr	O
Swoboda	B-PER
'	O
s	O
comments	O
on	O
the	O
activity	O
of	O
the	O
CEN	B-ORG
,	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
urging	O
them	O
to	O
speed	O
up	O
their	O
work	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
terrible	O
if	O
,	O
despite	O
the	O
new	O
deadline	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
find	O
ourselves	O
after	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
a	O
bit	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
difficulties	O
because	O
their	O
work	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
concluded	O
.	O

Lastly	O
,	O
Mr	O
President	O
,	O
the	O
basic	O
problems	O
justifying	O
this	O
amendment	O
of	O
the	O
directive	O
have	O
been	O
pointed	O
out	O
.	O
We	O
have	O
referred	O
to	O
the	O
delay	O
by	O
the	O
CEN	B-ORG
,	O
the	O
amendment	O
of	O
certain	O
provisions	O

between	O
the	O
text	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

the	O
need	O

for	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
specific	O

The	O
Commission	B-ORG
accepts	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
contributions	O

the	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
particularly	O
pleasing	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
first	O
speech	O
in	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Parliament	I-ORG
on	O
what	O
is	O
regarded	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
issue	O
within	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
United	B-LOC
Kingdom	I-LOC
that	O
I	O
represent	O
in	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
,	O
namely	O
Wales	B-LOC
.	O

A	O
major	O
part	O
of	O
Wales	B-LOC
,	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
has	O
been	O
granted	O
Objective	B-MISC
1	I-MISC
status	O
under	O
the	O
Structural	B-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
programme	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
quite	O
clear	O
that	O
many	O
people	O
within	O
Wales	B-LOC
are	O
looking	O
to	O
the	O
European	B-MISC
Structural	I-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
programme	O
to	O
alleviate	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
difficulties	O
that	O
we	O
undoubtedly	O
face	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
looking	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
within	O
the	O
Structural	B-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
programme	O
not	O
just	O
to	O
see	O
industrial	O
restructuring	O
but	O
also	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
wider	O
improvement	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
economic	O
base	O
within	O
the	O
Principality	B-LOC
.	O

What	O
is	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
deeply	O
damaging	O
for	O
us	O
is	O
the	O
belief	O
that	O
in	O
some	O
way	O
the	O
granting	O
of	O
Structural	B-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
assistance	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
sense	O
,	O
a	O
success	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
sadly	O
only	O
a	O
recognition	O
of	O
the	O
very	O
great	O
difficulties	O
that	O
Wales	B-LOC
faces	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
highlight	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
issues	O
that	O
I	O
believe	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
must	O
have	O
at	O
the	O
forefront	O
.	O

We	O
look	O
to	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
deal	O
with	O
points	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
additionality	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
dissatisfied	O
with	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
those	O
figures	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
some	O
way	O
hidden	O
within	O
UK	B-LOC
figures	O
.	O

We	O
look	O
to	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
also	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
matched	O
funding	O
for	O
projects	O
.	O

We	O
look	O
to	O
it	O
to	O
challenge	O
the	O
UK	B-ORG
Government	I-ORG
,	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
private	O
sector	O
,	O
which	O
surely	O
must	O
be	O
providing	O
the	O
major	O
impetus	O
for	O
Structural	B-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
expenditure	O
,	O
is	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
planning	O
stage	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
we	O
ask	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
ensures	O
that	O
Structural	B-MISC
Fund	I-MISC
monies	O
are	O
spent	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
which	O
is	O
transparent	O
.	O

Too	O
much	O
of	O
what	O
takes	O
place	O
within	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
is	O
not	O
transparent	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
one	O
area	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
believe	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
can	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
friend	O
to	O
Wales	B-LOC
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
our	O
committee	O
views	O
these	O
issues	O
very	O
differently	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
start	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
speak	O
from	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
of	O
research	O
.	O

This	O
will	O
be	O
possible	O
with	O
action	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
governments	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
decentralisation	O
of	O
higher	O
education	O
will	O
be	O
an	O
unquestionably	O
useful	O
policy	O
in	O
evening	O
out	O
development	O
.	O

Another	O
matter	O
we	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
address	O
,	O
specifically	O
from	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
of	O
industrial	O
policy	O
,	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
liked	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
pay	O
more	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
services	O
,	O
electronic	O
commerce	O
and	O
the	O
growing	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
Internet	B-MISC
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
planning	O
the	O
coordination	O
of	O
Structural	B-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
and	O
Cohesion	B-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
.	O

Poverty	O
and	O
wealth	O
used	O
to	O
depend	O
more	O
on	O
means	O
of	O
livelihood	O
.	O

The	O
rich	O
areas	O
were	O
those	O
where	O
there	O
were	O
jobs	O
in	O
industry	O
,	O
but	O
today	O
those	O
areas	O
might	O
have	O
become	O
a	O
burden	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
may	O
well	O
be	O
poor	O
,	O
meaning	O
we	O
also	O
have	O
to	O
invest	O
in	O
new	O
sectors	O
of	O
industry	O
such	O
as	O
electronic	O
production	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
production	O
of	O
services	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
industries	O
of	O
the	O
future	O
.	O

In	O
my	O
opinion	O
the	O
committee	O
drafting	O
the	O
report	O
has	O
not	O
taken	O
sufficient	O
account	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
so	O
on	O

of	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG

this	O
issue	O

Mr	O
President	O

I	O
would	O
very	O

Mrs	O

who	O
followed	O
this	O
for	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG

Affairs	I-ORG

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
draw	O
people	O
's	O
attention	O
to	O
Amendments	O
Nos	O
1	O
and	O
2	O
which	O
were	O
agreed	O
by	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG
on	I-ORG
Employment	I-ORG
and	I-ORG
Social	I-ORG
Affairs	I-ORG
but	O
not	O
accepted	O
by	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG
on	I-ORG
Regional	I-ORG
Policy	I-ORG
,	I-ORG
Transport	I-ORG
and	I-ORG
Tourism	I-ORG
.	O

These	O
amendments	O
deal	O
with	O
the	O
social	O
economy	O
and	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
provide	O
social	O
risk	O
capital	O
and	O
support	O
financially	O
local	O
schemes	O
to	O
develop	O
employment	O
opportunities	O
and	O
strengthen	O
social	O
cohesion	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
has	O
viewed	O
the	O
social	O
economy	O
as	O
an	O
important	O
potential	O
provider	O
of	O
employment	O
.	O

These	O
amendments	O
also	O
fit	O
in	O
with	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
's	O
view	O
that	O
social	O
exclusion	O
is	O
a	O
serious	O
issue	O
needing	O
constructive	O
action	O
.	O

We	O
hope	O
that	O
those	O
considering	O
rejection	O
of	O
these	O
amendments	O
have	O
very	O
powerful	O
reasons	O
to	O
offer	O
to	O
both	O
Parliament	B-ORG
and	O
their	O
citizens	O
who	O
are	O
seeking	O
employment	O
.	O

In	O
her	O
report	O
,	O
Mrs	O
Flautre	B-PER
also	O
drew	O
attention	O
to	O
an	O
area	O
where	O
coordination	O
is	O
sorely	O
lacking	O
,	O
yet	O
desperately	O
needed	O
.	O

The	O
Commission	B-ORG
proposals	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O
four	O
pillars	O
of	O
employment	O
strategy	O
and	O
the	O
five	O
fields	O
of	O
action	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-MISC
Social	I-MISC
Fund	I-MISC
.	O

But	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
specific	O
guidelines	O
here	O
is	O
particularly	O
to	O
be	O
regretted	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
linking	O
Social	B-MISC
Fund	I-MISC
assistance	O
to	O
the	O
employment	O
strategy	O
will	O
be	O
put	O
into	O
effect	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
during	O
the	O
2000-2006	O
programme	O
.	O

It	O
could	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
omission	O
gives	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
too	O
has	O
no	O
idea	O
how	O
to	O
provide	O
maximum	O
coordination	O
between	O
European	B-MISC

Fund	I-MISC
assistance	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
subject	O
to	O

We	O
hope	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
can	O
reassure	O
us	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
an	O
oversight	O
which	O
is	O
now	O
being	O
dealt	O
with	O
constructively	O

Mr	O
President	O

Commissioner	O
,	O
the	O
proposal	O
presented	O
by	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
,	O
in	O
accordance	O
with	O
its	O
mandate	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
reasonable	O
starting	O
point	O
for	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG
on	I-ORG
Agriculture	I-ORG
and	I-ORG
Rural	I-ORG
Development	I-ORG
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
point	O
out	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
starting	O
point	O
indicates	O
to	O
us	O
the	O
challenges	O
which	O
face	O
us	O
:	O
maintaining	O
a	O
population	O
in	O
rural	O
areas	O
,	O
given	O
the	O
changes	O
taking	O
place	O
in	O
all	O
types	O
of	O
economic	O
activity	O
owing	O
to	O
agriculture	O
'	O
s	O
increasing	O
lack	O
of	O
importance	O
amongst	O
the	O
various	O
sources	O
of	O
income	O
for	O
rural	O
society	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
deficiencies	O
in	O
the	O
networks	O
of	O
infrastructures	O
and	O
services	O
and	O
a	O
generally	O
very	O
low	O
level	O
of	O
employment	O
,	O
which	O
furthermore	O
is	O
seasonal	O
and	O
lacks	O
diversity	O
,	O
exacerbates	O
the	O
exodus	O
from	O
rural	O
areas	O
.	O

The	O
consequences	O
do	O
not	O
inspire	O
hope	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
young	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
disappearing	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
getting	O
an	O
education	O
and	O
finding	O
work	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
rural	O
areas	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
which	O
has	O
an	O
unfavourable	O
effect	O
on	O
those	O
areas	O
.	O

This	O
lack	O
of	O
infrastructure	O
is	O
also	O
an	O
obstacle	O
to	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
companies	O
and	O
the	O
creation	O
of	O
jobs	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
to	O
remember	O
that	O
rural	O
areas	O
represent	O
almost	O
four	O
fifths	O
of	O
the	O
territory	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
.	O

Agriculture	O
only	O
provides	O
5.5	O
%	O
of	O
employment	O
in	O
the	O
Union	B-ORG
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
three	O
quarters	O
of	O
our	O
farm	O
workers	O
are	O
part-time	O
and	O
require	O
supplements	O
to	O
their	O
incomes	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
we	O
support	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
an	O
agricultural	O
and	O
rural	O
development	O
policy	O
which	O
is	O
consistent	O
with	O
the	O
objectives	O
we	O
have	O
set	O
.	O
We	O
want	O
rural	O
areas	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
dawn	O
of	O
the	O
21st	O
century	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
competitive	O
and	O
multi-functional	O
,	O
both	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
agriculture	O
and	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
opening	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
diversity	O
of	O
non-agricultural	O
activities	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
prioritise	O
general	O
criteria	O
for	O
land	O
planning	O
and	O
demographic	O
equilibrium	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bear	O
in	O
mind	O
the	O
conclusions	O
of	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG
on	I-ORG
Agriculture	I-ORG
and	I-ORG
Rural	I-ORG
Development	I-ORG
on	O
the	O
five	O
fundamental	O
issues	O
,	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
only	O
partly	O
taken	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG
on	I-ORG
Transport	I-ORG

Policy	I-ORG
and	I-ORG
Tourism	I-ORG
in	O
its	O
points	O
16	O
and	O
17	O
.	O

In	O
conclusion	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
ask	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
take	O
these	O
five	O
points	O
into	O
account	O
when	O
establishing	O
the	O
conclusions	O
on	O
the	O
four	O
pillars	O
because	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
,	O
maintaining	O
the	O
population	O
in	O
rural	O
areas	O
must	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
priority	O
objectives	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
also	O
like	O
to	O
thank	O
her	O
for	O
her	O
willingness	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
dialogue	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
political	O
groups	O
when	O
compromise	O
formulas	O
have	O
needed	O
to	O
be	O
reached	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
this	O
avalanche	O
of	O
amendments	O
-	O
and	O
perhaps	O
there	O
are	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
than	O
we	O
expected	O
-	O
but	O
which	O
genuinely	O
reflect	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
the	O
report	O
we	O
are	O
now	O
discussing	O
.	O

We	O
feel	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
takes	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
conclusions	O
adopted	O
by	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
,	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
spirit	O
,	O
because	O
at	O
this	O
stage	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
seem	O
as	O
though	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
doing	O
here	O
is	O
a	O
useless	O
exercise	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
but	O
hot	O
air	O

The	O
truth	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
though	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
believe	O
-	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
also	O
shown	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
conclusions	O
have	O
been	O
drafted	O
-	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
must	O
take	O
account	O
of	O
what	O
is	O
adopted	O
by	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
,	O
particularly	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
an	O

revision	O
of	O

In	O

achieve	O
a	O
more	O
rapid	O
and	O
efficient	O
boost	O
for	O
attaining	O
these	O
objectives	O
,	O
we	O
think	O
that	O
those	O
who	O
generate	O
employment	O

the	O
real	O
entrepreneurs	O
and	O
those	O
who	O
really	O
guarantee	O

,	O
that	O
is	O

this	O

Small	O

need	O
to	O

If	O

All	O

Let	O
me	O
also	O
remind	O
him	O
that	O
when	O
his	O
party	O
leader	O
,	O
Mr	O
Hague	B-PER
,	O
was	O
Secretary	O
of	O
State	O
for	O
Wales	B-LOC
,	O
he	O
broke	O
every	O
rule	O
in	O
the	O
book	O
on	O
additionality	O
which	O
led	O
to	O
a	O
stern	O
letter	O
from	O
Commissioner	O
Wulf-Mathies	B-PER
regarding	O
regulatory	O
requirements	O
.	O

My	O
Group	O
has	O
made	O
extensive	O
amendments	O
to	O
both	O
reports	O
up	O
for	O
debate	O
today	O
.	O

The	O
operation	O
of	O
the	O
previous	O
round	O
of	O
programmes	O
is	O
also	O
very	O
instructive	O
in	O
telling	O
us	O
what	O
guidelines	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
about	O
.	O

The	O
implementation	O
and	O
operation	O
of	O
the	O
guidelines	O
cannot	O
be	O
left	O
to	O
the	O
personal	O
interpretation	O
of	O
one	O
or	O
other	O
desk	O
officer	O
,	O
either	O
in	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
or	O
in	O
the	O
civil	O
service	O
.	O

There	O
must	O
be	O
an	O
internal	O
coherence	O
in	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
directorate	O
,	O
while	O
respecting	O
the	O
specific	O
local	O
and	O
regional	O
aspects	O
of	O
Commission	B-ORG
programmes	O
.	O

The	O
conclusion	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
make	O
the	O
case	O
for	O
guidelines	O
to	O
be	O
broad	O
,	O
indicative	O
and	O
flexible	O
to	O
assist	O
our	O
programme	O
managers	O
and	O
fund-users	O
and	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
maximum	O
potential	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
new	O
fields	O
of	O
regeneration	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
can	O
inject	O
a	O
spirit	O
of	O
entrepreneurial	O
activity	O
into	O
our	O
poor	O
and	O
structurally	O
weak	O
regions	O
we	O
will	O
eventually	O
get	O
them	O
back	O
onto	O
the	O
road	O
of	O
attracting	O
substantial	O
investor	O
confidence	O
,	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
key	O
to	O
future	O
success	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
how	O
we	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
judge	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
these	O
guidelines	O
:	O
whether	O
EU	B-MISC
regional	I-MISC
policy	I-MISC
with	O
a	O
good	O
,	O
solid	O
,	O
enabling	O
guideline	O
,	O
can	O
open	O
up	O
new	O
opportunities	O
and	O
allow	O
our	O
poor	O
and	O
structurally	O
weak	O
regions	O
to	O
play	O
their	O
full	O
part	O
in	O
contributing	O
to	O
the	O
growth	O
and	O
prosperity	O
of	O
the	O
EU	B-ORG
.	O

The	O
rapporteur	O
has	O
also	O
quite	O
rightly	O
stated	O
that	O
Parliament	B-ORG
was	O
not	O
heard	O
in	O
time	O
regarding	O
the	O
guidelines	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
badly	O
behind	O
now	O
in	O
this	O
matter	O
.	O

Hopefully	O
,	O
the	O
stands	O
Parliament	B-ORG
has	O
taken	O
will	O
help	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
mid-term	O
appraisal	O
of	O
the	O
programmes	O
and	O
in	O
their	O
practical	O
implementation	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
stage	O
it	O
is	O
more	O
important	O
to	O
concentrate	O
on	O
assessing	O
how	O
we	O
can	O
use	O
this	O
process	O
to	O
steer	O
Union	B-MISC
regional	I-MISC
policy	I-MISC
,	O
bearing	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
the	O
aim	O
is	O
to	O
reduce	O
regional	O
inequality	O

Our	O

also	O
considers	O
it	O
important	O
to	O
take	O
greater	O

to	O

achieve	O

We	O

to	O

also	O
in	O

We	O
are	O

we	O

a	O

for	O

Some	O

We	O
will	O

It	O
is	O

from	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
the	O
European	B-ORG

the	O

the	O

that	O
this	O

We	O
need	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
on	O
numerous	O
occasions	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
I	O
have	O
disagreed	O
with	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
on	O
her	O
approach	O
to	O
regional	O
policy	O
issues	O
.	O
This	O
time	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
actually	O
agree	O
with	O
her	O

Whether	O
or	O
not	O
this	O
will	O
encourage	O
her	O
to	O
continue	O
along	O

I	O
would	O

to	O

her	O
on	O
her	O

The	O
second	O
point	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
preferred	O
it	O
if	O
the	O

been	O
added	O
to	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O

this	O

Mr	O
Bernié	B-PER
is	O
not	O
to	O

this	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
matter	O
for	O
the	O
previous	O

I	O
am	O
raising	O
the	O
issue	O
just	O
to	O
reiterate	O
Parliament	B-ORG
'	O

position	O

Thirdly	O
,	O
we	O
broadly	O
agree	O
on	O
the	O
general	O
guidelines	O
provided	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
deviate	O
from	O
the	O
comments	O
we	O
have	O
made	O
so	O

They	O
are	O
particularly	O
beneficial	O
to	O
the	O
Member	B-ORG
States	I-ORG
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
particularly	O
like	O
to	O
draw	O
your	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
emphasis	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
has	O
placed	O
on	O
the	O
issues	O
of	O
sustainable	O
development	O

more	O

Personally	O

I	O
at	O

am	O
totally	O
in	O

of	O
the	O
guidelines	O

As	O
an	O
islander	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
express	O
my	O
dissatisfaction	O
at	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
recognition	O
of	O
island	O

This	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
that	O
this	O
issue	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
given	O
the	O
consideration	O
it	O
deserves	O
.	O
This	O
has	O
been	O
an	O
ongoing	O
concern	O
for	O
the	O
five	O
years	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
Member	O
of	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG

and	O
I	O
have	O
raised	O
the	O
issue	O
time	O
and	O
time	O
again	O

The	O
time	O
has	O
come	O
to	O
implement	O
the	O
programmes	O

and	O
so	O
Member	B-ORG

should	O
also	O
assume	O
their	O

do	O
their	O
jobs	O
properly	O

As	O
for	O
us	O
in	O
Parliament	B-ORG
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
remind	O
you	O
of	O
the	O
code	O
of	O
conduct	O
between	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
and	O
Parliament	B-ORG
which	O
was	O
signed	O
in	O
May	O

I	O
am	O
absolutely	O
certain	O
that	O
this	O
code	O
will	O
be	O
observed	O

that	O

will	O
keep	O

Mr	O
President	O

I	O
too	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
congratulate	O
the	O
rapporteur	O

her	O
excellent	O
work	O

Over	O

more	O

To	O
this	O

Europe	B-LOC
as	O
a	O
whole	O
,	O
and	O
each	O
Member	O

of	O
all	O

the	O

For	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
possible	O

what	O
we	O
need	O
from	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Commission	I-ORG
are	O
not	O
just	O
good	O
intentions	O

but	O
clearer	O
guidelines	O
and	O
a	O
firm	O
commitment	O
to	O
monitoring	O
the	O
way	O
these	O

are	O
used	O
by	O
the	O
Member	B-ORG

For	O
example	O
,	O
in	O
recent	O
years	O
Italy	B-LOC
has	O
had	O
problems	O
in	O
utilising	O
the	O
Structural	B-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
,	O
mainly	O
because	O
of	O
excessive	O
bureaucracy	O

a	O
lack	O
of	O
involvement	O
of	O
economic	O

This	O
is	O
something	O
about	O
which	O
European	B-MISC

medium-sized	O
businesses	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
tend	O
to	O
complain	O

I	O
will	O
conclude	O
,	O
Mr	O

,	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
the	O
failure	O
of	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG

to	O
focus	O
on	O

of	O

unemployment	O
among	O

is	O
cause	O
for	O
serious	O
concern	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
like	O
my	O
colleague	O
Mr	O
Evans	B-PER
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
particular	O
pleasure	O
to	O
rise	O
and	O
make	O
my	O
first	O
speech	O
to	O
this	O
House	B-ORG
on	O
this	O
very	O
important	O
issue	O
,	O
especially	O
since	O
I	O
represent	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
United	B-LOC
Kingdom	I-LOC
,	O
the	O
West	B-LOC
Midlands	I-LOC
,	O
which	O
has	O
hitherto	O
benefited	O
from	O
Objective	B-MISC
2	I-MISC
funding	O
in	O
particular	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
report	O
before	O
the	O
House	O
tonight	O
is	O
a	O
prime	O
example	O
of	O
how	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
very	O
careful	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
produce	O
very	O
grandiose-sounding	O
ideas	O
that	O
lack	O
the	O
substance	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
relevant	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
benefit	O
directly	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
report	O
itself	O
is	O
well-intentioned	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
so	O
often	O
when	O
we	O
deal	O
with	O
these	O
issues	O
,	O
lacks	O
clarity	O
of	O
purpose	O
and	O
a	O
sound	O
basis	O
for	O
operability	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
and	O
my	O
Group	O
are	O
proposing	O
three	O
key	O
amendments	O
and	O
additions	O
to	O
the	O
text	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
take	O
anything	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
proposal	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
more	O
relevant	O
to	O
those	O
whom	O
it	O
is	O
there	O
to	O
guide	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
explain	O
our	O
thinking	O
here	O
.	O

Firstly	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
concerned	O
with	O
the	O
proper	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
Structural	B-MISC
and	O
Cohesion	B-MISC
Funds	I-MISC
.	O

Past	O
experience	O
dictates	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
elected	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-MISC
taxpayer	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
must	O
,	O
demand	O
financial	O
probity	O
and	O
transparency	O
in	O
the	O
disbursement	O
and	O
auditing	O
of	O
this	O
money	O
,	O
hence	O
our	O
amendments	O
and	O
additions	O
relate	O
to	O
achieving	O
what	O
are	O
known	O
as	O
"	O
value	O
for	O
money	O
"	O
indicators	O
in	O
the	O
grant-giving	O
process	O
.	O

Next	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
too	O
often	O
see	O
vast	O
sums	O
of	O
money	O
being	O
spent	O
on	O
projects	O
whose	O
outcomes	O
will	O
necessarily	O
be	O
unclear	O
at	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
the	O
programme	O
period	O
.	O

But	O
at	O
the	O
mid-way	O
point	O
or	O
end	O
of	O
that	O
period	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
effective	O
way	O
of	O
terminating	O
the	O
project	O
if	O
it	O
has	O
not	O
proved	O
successful	O
.	O

Our	O
additions	O
therefore	O
call	O
for	O
the	O
provision	O
of	O
practical	O
enforceable	O
exit	O
strategies	O
so	O
that	O
not	O
only	O
can	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
requisite	O
insurance	O
against	O
ongoing	O
costs	O
which	O
are	O
often	O
loaded	O
onto	O
the	O
taxpayer	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
also	O
avoid	O
the	O
well-rehearsed	O
syndrome	O
of	O
throwing	O

Mr	O

I	O
too	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
commend	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
on	O
her	O
report	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
meticulous	O
and	O
substantive	O
piece	O
of	O

These	O

can	O
only	O
be	O
achieved	O
through	O
their	O

on	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O

thought-out	O

Let	O
us	O
not	O
forget	O
that	O
when	O
these	O
policies	O
are	O
effective	O
,	O
they	O
also	O
benefit	O
European	B-MISC
citizens	O

directly	O
improving	O
their	O
quality	O

Let	O
us	O
not	O
forget	O
either	O
that	O
greater	O
consideration	O
should	O
be	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
islands	O
and	O
remote	O
regions	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-ORG

because	O
their	O
geographical	O
location	O
is	O
a	O
hindrance	O
to	O
their	O
economic	O

social	O
development	O

unless	O

the	O

In	O
closing	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
point	O
out	O
that	O
the	O
structural	O
policies	O
as	O
a	O
whole	O
require	O
greater	O
flexibility	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
adapt	O
to	O
changing	O

thereby	O
respond	O
to	O
the	O
new	O

of	O
the	O

we	O
all	O
hope	O
for	O
the	O
best	O

Quite	O

does	O
not	O
ease	O
the	O
problem	O
of	O
mass	O
unemployment	O

any	O
way	O

rather	O
it	O
aggravates	O
it	O

The	O

been	O
irreparably	O
damaged	O
by	O

Mr	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
say	O
a	O
few	O
words	O
in	O

to	O
highlight	O
two	O
points	O
made	O
in	O
these	O
reports	O
which	O
are	O
of	O
fundamental	O
strategic	O
importance	O
to	O
the	O
way	O
we	O
see	O
the	O
Union	B-ORG
.	O

The	O
first	O
is	O
the	O
fundamental	O
,	O
central	O
importance	O
that	O
we	O
continue	O
to	O
give	O
to	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
economic	O

We	O
are	O
concerned	O
to	O
hear	O
news	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
is	O
taking	O
this	O
objective	O
less	O
seriously	O
.	O

We	O
still	O
feel	O
that	O
economic	O

social	O

is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

fundamental	O
objectives	O

Secondly	O
,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
what	O
has	O
already	O

said	O
on	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
would	O
also	O

bring	O
the	O

In	O

we	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
ask	O
if	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG

able	O
to	O
enlighten	O
us	O
on	O
the	O
reasons	O
for	O
the	O
delay	O

Mr	O

positive	O

The	O
first	O
is	O
that	O

,	O
factor	O

The	O
negative	O
conclusion	O
is	O
that	O

Mr	O

I	O
would	O
first	O

the	O

We	O

require	O
an	O

analysis	O

why	O

not	O
producing	O
the	O
desired	O
result	O
in	O
all	O
areas	O

Is	O
the	O
reason	O
bureaucracy	O
or	O
is	O
it	O
because	O
insufficient	O
notice	O
has	O
been	O
taken	O
of	O
interregional	O
differences	O
,	O

How	O
can	O
the	O
Union	B-ORG
respond	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

of	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
follow	O
the	O
example	O
of	O
others	O

call	O
on	O
the	O

to	O

sooner	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
Commissioner	O
,	O
following	O
close	O
scrutiny	O
of	O
this	O
report	O
one	O
cannot	O
escape	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O
fulfil	O
the	O
stated	O
objective	O
of	O
the	O
structural	B-MISC
policy	I-MISC
only	O
in	O
part	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
whilst	O
the	O
disparities	O
between	O
the	O

have	O
increased	O
rather	O
than	O
decreased	O

there	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
convergence	O
between	O

Equally	O
,	O
unemployment	O

fell	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
indeed	O
they	O
rose	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
.	O

I	O
wonder	O
why	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
structural	B-MISC
funds	I-MISC
are	O
not	O
employed	O
more	O
efficiently	O
.	O

Even	O
the	O
accumulation	O
of	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
cohesion	B-MISC
funds	I-MISC
and	O
the	O
structural	B-MISC
funds	I-MISC
has	O
failed	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
desired	O
effect	O
in	O
all	O
regions	O
and	O
countries	O
.	O

Genuine	O
structural	O
reforms	O
and	O
a	O
competition-friendly	O
taxation	O
policy	O
are	O
the	O
cornerstones	O
of	O
a	O
successful	O
economic	O
base	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
wish	O
to	O
stand	O
accused	O
of	O
pursuing	O
a	O
cost-intensive	O
structural	O
policy	O
that	O
does	O
nothing	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
unemployment	O
situation	O
in	O
the	O
long	O
term	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
measures	O
drawn	O
up	O
so	O
far	O
must	O
be	O
analysed	O
.	O

We	O
will	O
only	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
structural	B-MISC
policy	I-MISC
of	I-MISC
the	I-MISC
Union	I-MISC
has	O
been	O
a	O
success	O
when	O
we	O
manage	O
to	O
create	O
a	O
sufficient	O
number	O
of	O
jobs	O
and	O
when	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
significant	O
reduction	O
in	O
the	O
unemployment	O
rate	O
.	O

This	O
issue	O
,	O
which	O
has	O
an	O
impact	O
on	O
their	O
everyday	O
life	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
key	O
issue	O
as	O
regards	O
EU	B-ORG
credibility	O

It	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
conceded	O
that	O
the	O
EU	B-ORG
has	O
already	O
aided	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
quite	O
magnificently	O
,	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
poor	O
countries	O
.	O

The	O
EU	B-ORG
really	O
deserves	O
such	O
a	O
gesture	O
,	O
but	O
differences	O
between	O
rich	O
and	O
poor	O
areas	O
within	O
countries	O
are	O
still	O
too	O
great	O
.	O

What	O
is	O
the	O
result	O
?	O

react	O
by	O
voting	O
with	O
their	O
feet	O
and	O
go	O
where	O
they	O
can	O
earn	O
a	O
crust	O
.	O

Consequently	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
build	O
schools	O
,	O
hospitals	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
infrastructure	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
country	O
many	O
times	O
over	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
very	O
costly	O
and	O
it	O
also	O
causes	O
very	O
great	O
social	O
problems	O
.	O

Most	O
people	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
the	O

in	O
which	O
they	O
were	O

if	O

was	O
work	O
there	O
.	O

We	O
must	O
give	O
them	O
this	O
opportunity	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
moral	O
obligation	O
the	O
EU	B-ORG
and	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
have	O
.	O

The	O
solution	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
see	O
it	O
,	O
lies	O
in	O
clearly	O
encouraging	O
entrepreneurship	O

What	O
is	O
a	O
fair	O
society	O
?	O

One	O
in	O
which	O
someone	O
from	O
a	O

can	O
get	O

as	O
to	O
make	O

little	O
easier	O

In	O
this	O
way	O

positive	O
development	O
of	O

if	O

Finally	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
matter	O
we	O
should	O
learn	O
a	O
lesson	O
from	O
America	B-LOC

where	O

work	O
is	O

wish	O

I	O
hope	O
that	O

will	O
learn	O
the	O
lessons	O
and	O
not	O
repeat	O
this	O
unnecessary	O
exercise	O
which	O
I	O
believe	O
was	O
founded	O
on	O
a	O
misapprehension	O

On	O
reading	O
both	O
Commission	B-ORG
documents	O
,	O
one	O
learns	O
that	O
1998	O
was	O
the	O
year	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
modernisation	O
proposals	O
introduced	O
in	O
1997	O
were	O
pursued	O

even	O

which	O
is	O
something	O
our	O
own	O
ongoing	O

work	O
has	O
taught	O
us	O

It	O
should	O
continue	O
along	O

But	O
,	O

none	O

this	O
is	O
to	O

in	O

Indeed	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
just	O
about	O
modernisation	O
of	O
Community	B-MISC
law	I-MISC
,	O
more	O
than	O
anything	O
it	O
is	O
about	O

The	O

report	O

is	O
not	O
a	O
bad	O
foundation	O
for	O

there	O
is	O
nothing	O

the	O
distribution	O
of	O
competences	O
between	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
and	O
Parliament	B-ORG
into	O
question	O
.	O

The	O
Commission	B-ORG
is	O
the	O
executive	O
and	O
Parliament	B-ORG
ought	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
desire	O
whatsoever	O
to	O
take	O
on	O
this	O
role	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
independence	O
;	O
but	O
Parliament	B-ORG
is	O
a	O
supervisory	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
better	O
forum	O
could	O
there	O
be	O
in	O
which	O
to	O
expound	O
the	O
reasoning	O
behind	O
one	O
'	O

democratically-elected	O
Parliament	B-ORG
,	O
indeed	O
an	O
ongoing	O
parliamentary	B-MISC
discussion	O
?	O

Here	O
too	O
we	O
should	O
continue	O
along	O
the	O
path	O
we	O
have	O
chosen	O
,	O
strengthening	O
and	O
intensifying	O
it	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
one	O
thing	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
quite	O
clear	O
though	O
.	O
Parliament	B-ORG
is	O
a	O
legislative	O
body	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
consultation	O
in	O
matters	O
of	O
competition	O
law	O
,	O
of	O
all	O
things	O
,	O
is	O
truly	O
scandalous	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
urge	O
the	O
Council	B-ORG
and	O
the	O
Intergovernmental	B-ORG
Conference	I-ORG
to	O
introduce	O
the	O
codecision	O
procedure	O
into	O
legislation	O
in	O
this	O
area	O
.	O

I	O
expect	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
exploit	O
every	O
available	O
opportunity	O
for	O
parliamentary	B-MISC
cooperation	O
and	O
to	O
involve	O
Parliament	B-ORG
in	O
doubtful	O
cases	O
,	O
even	O
given	O
the	O
Treaty	B-MISC
status	O
quo	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
expect	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
be	O
pro-active	O
in	O
supporting	O
us	O
in	O
our	O
call	O
for	O

the	O
report	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
propose	O
to	O
you	O
today	O
is	O
an	O
opinion	O
on	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG

Annual	O
Report	O
on	O
the	O
state	O

The	O
Commission	B-ORG
report	O
is	O
essentially	O
a	O
descriptive	O
report	O
detailing	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
state	O
aid	O
in	O
the	O
manufacturing	O
sector	O
and	O
certain	O
other	O
sectors	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
various	O
typologies	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
method	O
of	O
financing	O
and	O
the	O
objectives	O
pursued	O
.	O

To	O
put	O
it	O
plainly	O
,	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
state	O
aid	O
declared	O
,	O
roughly	O
speaking	O
,	O
is	O
generally	O
stable	O
during	O
the	O
period	O
under	O
discussion	O
and	O
comes	O
to	O
approximately	O
1.2	O
%	O
of	O
Community	O
GDP	O
or	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
the	O
equivalent	O
,	O
coincidentally	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
Community	B-ORG
budget	O
for	O
one	O
year	O
.	O

This	O
being	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
considerable	O
disparities	O
between	O
states	O
,	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
measured	O
in	O
various	O
ways	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
,	O
for	O

,	O
as	O
a	O
percentage	O
of	O
added	O
value	O
and	O
per	O
wage	O
earner	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
interesting	O
to	O
add	O
state	O
aid	O
and	O
Community	B-ORG
aid	O
,	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
assimilated	O
in	O
some	O
way	O
into	O
state	O
aid	O

This	O
clearly	O
shows	O
that	O
it	O
is	O

Commissioner	O

stressing	O
two	O

a	O
concern	O

a	O

The	O
concern	O

the	O
pre-accession	O

As	O
you	O
know	O

Commissioner	O

our	O

that	O

The	O

The	O

The	O
rules	O

were	O
drawn	O
up	O
on	O
18	O
December	O

These	O
stipulate	O
that	O

can	O
only	O
be	O
awarded	O

for	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
obviously	O
problems	O
with	O
the	O
practical	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
steel	B-MISC
aid	I-MISC
code	I-MISC
over	O
the	O
past	O
few	O
years	O
that	O
were	O
not	O
brought	O
fully	O
to	O
bear	O
in	O
the	O
report	O
.	O

As	O
far	O
as	O
Parliament	B-ORG
is	O
concerned	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
waste	O
no	O
time	O
in	O
getting	O
down	O
to	O
a	O
debate	O
on	O
the	O
regulations	O
that	O
are	O
to	O
succeed	O
this	O
state	O
aid	B-MISC
code	I-MISC
once	O
it	O
has	O
expired	O
.	O

There	O
must	O
be	O
no	O
watering-down	O
of	O
the	O
existing	O
principles	O
underlying	O
the	O
steel	B-MISC
aid	I-MISC
code	I-MISC
.	O

No	O
one	O
wants	O
an	O
unimpeded	O
subsidy	O
competition	O
in	O
Europe	B-LOC
.	O

This	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
the	O
considerable	O
disadvantage	O
of	O
the	O
internal	O
market	O
,	O
regardless	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
steel	O
industry	O
has	O
undergone	O
consolidation	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
few	O
years	O
.	O

Consequently	O
,	O
Parliament	B-ORG
believes	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
the	O
steel	B-MISC
aid	I-MISC
code	I-MISC
to	O
be	O
amended	O
in	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
industry	O
'	O
s	O
claims	O
about	O
unequal	O
treatment	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
provide	O
the	O
Council	B-ORG
with	O
follow-up	O
regulations	O
.	O

We	O
all	O
know	O
that	O
so	O
far	O
the	O
Council	B-ORG
has	O
dragged	O
its	O
feet	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
follow-up	O
regulations	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
.	O

The	O
reason	O
for	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
under	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O
once	O
the	O
steel	B-MISC
aid	I-MISC
code	I-MISC
expires	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
their	O
own	O
thing	O
again	O
without	O
the	O
inconvenience	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Commission	I-ORG
'	O
s	O
supervision	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
demand	O
that	O
once	O
the	O
Treaty	B-MISC
expires	O
,	O
steel	O
aid	O
must	O
be	O
regulated	O
by	O
a	O
Council	B-ORG
regulation	O
according	O
to	O
Article	O
94	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
create	O
the	O
necessary	O
legal	O
validity	O
and	O
clarity	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
enforce	O
the	O
strict	O
ban	O
on	O
all	O
aid	O
not	O
covered	O
by	O
the	O
code	O
.	O

A	O
Council	B-ORG
regulation	O
that	O
is	O
directly	O
applicable	O
law	O
must	O
also	O
be	O
observed	O
by	O
the	O
regional	O
governments	O
.	O

What	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
avoid	O
doing	O
in	O
the	O
future	O
is	O
compromising	O
competition	O
conditions	O
and	O
disturbing	O
the	O
balance	O
in	O
the	O
markets	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
need	O
to	O
criticise	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
'	O
s	O
practice	O
of	O
approving	O
multiple	O
aid	O
packages	O
for	O
steel	O
enterprises	O
which	O
in	O
their	O
view	O
,	O
do	O
not	O
fall	O
within	O
the	O
categories	O
of	O
the	O
code	O
,	O
even	O
given	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Court	I-ORG
of	I-ORG
Justice	I-ORG
approved	O
this	O
unequal	O
treatment	O
where	O
certain	O
individual	O
decisions	O
were	O
concerned	O
.	O

The	O
Commission	B-ORG
will	O
be	O
called	O
upon	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
report	O
that	O
has	O
yet	O
to	O
be	O
compiled	O
for	O
the	O
year	O
1999	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
detailed	O
explanation	O
of	O
its	O
active	O
role	O
in	O
the	O
elaboration	O
of	O
restructuring	O
plans	O
and	O
approved	O
exemptions	O
,	O
thus	O
enabling	O
a	O
proper	O
assessment	O
of	O
the	O
overall	O
situation	O
to	O
be	O
made	O

Once	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG
on	I-ORG
Economic	I-ORG

Monetary	I-ORG
Affairs	I-ORG
has	O
adopted	O
the	O
draft	O
report	O
unanimously	O
with	O
two	O
abstentions	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
ask	O
that	O
we	O
make	O
full	O
use	O
of	O
this	O
opportunity	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
ourselves	O
created	O
,	O
in	O
plenary	O
sitting	O
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
new	O
Member	O
I	O
am	O
pleased	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
maiden	O
speech	O
here	O
today	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
delay	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
begin	O
by	O
thanking	O
the	O
rapporteurs	O
Mr	O
von	B-PER
Wogau	I-PER
,	O
Mr	O
Langen	B-PER
,	O
Mr	O
Rapkay	B-PER
and	O
Mr	O
Jonckheer	B-PER
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
,	O
for	O
their	O
excellent	O
cooperation	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
have	O
now	O
arrived	O
at	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
develop	O
competition	O
policy	O
further	O
.	O

The	O
Commission	B-ORG
has	O
put	O
forward	O
a	O
new	O
White	O
Paper	O
on	O
this	O
containing	O
two	O
key	O
points	O
:	O
dropping	O
the	O
obligation	O
to	O
notify	O
and	O
retrodisplacement	O
of	O
law	O
enforcement	O
.	O

Dropping	O
the	O
obligation	O
to	O
notify	O
will	O
mean	O
less	O
red	O
tape	O
and	O
administration	O
costs	O
,	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
this	O
change	O
of	O
system	O
will	O
also	O
lead	O
to	O
more	O
onus	O
being	O
placed	O
on	O
the	O
individual	O
in	O
the	O
business	O
world	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
no	O
longer	O
simply	O
be	O
a	O
case	O
of	O
submitting	O
papers	O
and	O
having	O
them	O
approved	O
;	O
for	O
one	O
thing	O
,	O
each	O
person	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
responsibility	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
probably	O
why	O
there	O
is	O
unease	O
about	O
this	O
in	O
other	O
quarters	O
.	O

However	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
use	O
this	O
opportunity	O
for	O
Europe	B-LOC
to	O
set	O
down	O
a	O
marker	O
for	O
less	O
red	O
tape	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
point	O
relates	O
to	O
the	O
retrodisplacement	O
of	O
law	O
enforcement	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
create	O
a	O
culture	O
of	O
law	O
in	O
Europe	B-LOC
,	O
then	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
law	O
must	O
be	O
applied	O
not	O
only	O
by	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
,	O
by	O
central	O
bodies	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
by	O
national	O
authorities	O
,	O
by	O
national	O
courts	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
not	O
discussing	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
although	O
every	O
EU	B-ORG
law	O
is	O
only	O
ever	O
decided	O
on	O
centrally	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
precisely	O
the	O
adaptation	O
phase	O
where	O
we	O
will	O
experience	O
a	O
lack	O
of	O
legal	O
certainty	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
certainly	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
develop	O
an	O
instrument	O
for	O
this	O
in	O
the	O
anticipated	O
legislative	O
procedure	O
that	O
will	O
enable	O
enterprises	O
to	O
enjoy	O
legal	O
certainty	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
recourse	O
to	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
in	O
this	O
matter	O
.	O

The	O
way	O
to	O
a	O
European	B-MISC
monopolies	O
commission	O
must	O
be	O
kept	O
clear	O
,	O
something	O
that	O
will	O
certainly	O
form	O
a	O
subject	O
for	O
future	O
discussion	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
need	O
there	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
transparency	O
in	O
the	O
competition	B-MISC
policy	I-MISC
.	O

Parliament	B-ORG
must	O
have	O
more	O
involvement	O
and	O
I	O
also	O
believe	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
introduce	O
a	O
register	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
ascertain	O
what	O
state	O
aid	O
is	O
being	O
granted	O
,	O
then	O
this	O
would	O
encourage	O
the	O
Member	B-ORG
States	I-ORG
to	O
be	O
more	O
disciplined	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
future	O
holds	O
for	O
competition	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
issues	O
dear	O
to	O
my	O
heart	O
.	O

One	O
is	O
subsidiarity	O
.	O

This	O
own	O
initiative	O
must	O
not	O
be	O
destroyed	O
by	O
European	B-MISC
intervention	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
there	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
need	O
to	O
raise	O
the	O
de	O
minimis	O
regulation	O
.	O

We	O
should	O
do	O
everything	O
within	O
our	O
power	O
to	O
force	O
the	O
regions	O
into	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
compete	O
with	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

My	O
second	O
point	O
relates	O
to	O
discussion	O
about	O
competition	O
and	O
the	O
social	O
market	O
economy	O
,	O
although	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
market	O
failure	O
just	O
now	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
already	O
referred	O
to	O
the	O
regional	O
and	O
savings	O
bank	O
sector	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
just	O
like	O
to	O
focus	O
on	O
a	O
matter	O
one	O
hears	O
again	O
and	O
again	O
in	O
certain	O
quarters	O
.	O

These	O
days	O
,	O
someone	O
who	O
lives	O
in	O
an	O
old	O
people	O
'	O
s	O
home	O
is	O
accommodated	O
within	O
the	O
social	O
field	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
also	O
regard	O
them	O
as	O
a	O
customer	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
we	O
should	O
enter	O
into	O
rather	O
clear	O
and	O
timely	O
discussion	O
on	O
the	O
ways	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
social	O
field	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
evolved	O
structures	O
,	O
stifle	O
competition	O
.	O

Apart	O
from	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
refer	O
to	O
any	O
customers	O
,	O
any	O
sector	O
,	O
as	O
customers	O
,	O
and	O
thereby	O
have	O
a	O

:	O
Holzmann	B-ORG

These	O
are	O
three	O
areas	O

which	O
many	O
Danish	B-MISC

are	O
experiencing	O
major	O
problems	O
and	O
are	O
being	O
squeezed	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
markets	O
.	O

I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
Mr	O
Poos	B-PER
that	O
I	O
very	O
much	O
agree	O
with	O
Mr	O
Duisenberg	B-PER
that	O
these	O
examples	O
show	O
that	O
some	O
EU	B-ORG
Member	O
States	O
are	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
to	O
restructure	O
their	O

,	O
to	O
that	O
extent	O
,	O
are	O
helping	O
to	O
undermine	O
the	O
value	O
of	O

I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
thank	O
my	O
colleagues	O
on	O
the	O
committee	O
for	O
supporting	O
the	O
amendments	O
tabled	O
by	O
the	O
Group	B-ORG

European	I-ORG
Liberal	I-ORG

As	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
our	O
amendments	O
concern	O
transparency	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
emphasise	O
the	O
amendment	O
which	O
urges	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
propose	O
uniform	O
criteria	O
and	O
conditions	O
for	O
the	O
type	O
of	O
state	O
aids	O
we	O
consider	O
to	O
be	O
lawful	O
,	O
specifically	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
companies	O
can	O
predict	O
what	O
their	O
situation	O
will	O
be	O
.	O

Another	O
issue	O
is	O
that	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
do	O
when	O
state	O
aid	O
is	O
declared	O
unlawful	O
.	O

How	O
do	O
we	O
ensure	O
that	O
unlawful	O
state	O
aid	O
is	O
paid	O
back	O
?	O

At	O
present	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
common	O
rules	O
in	O
this	O
area	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
vigorously	O
urge	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
to	O
make	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
harmonising	O
the	O
rules	O
on	O
repayment	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
way	O
forward	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
ensure	O
uniform	O
conditions	O
of	O
competition	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
we	O
propose	O
keeping	O
both	O
a	O
register	O
,	O
as	O
mentioned	O
by	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
my	O

I	O
very	O
much	O
hope	O
that	O
you	O
,	O
Commissioner	O
Monti	B-PER

will	O

I	O
look	O

out	O

you	O
stand	O

I	O

But	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
already	O

our	O

There	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
need	O
to	O
tighten	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
areas	O
mentioned	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
therefore	O
good	O
reason	O
for	O
continuing	O
to	O

resolutely	O

the	O

As	O
Liberals	O

we	O
clearly	O
have	O
different	O
opinions	O
on	O
how	O
the	O
world	O
should	O
look	O

but	O
we	O
are	O
well	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
agreement	O
as	O
to	O
our	O
objectives	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
shall	O
try	O

find	O
reasonable	O
solutions	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
Commissioner	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
just	O
two	O
questions	O
which	O
must	O
be	O
answered	O
.	O

Are	O
state	O
aid	O
to	O
business	O
or	O
inter-company	O
agreements	O
legitimate	O
in	O
a	O
market	O
economy	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
must	O
supervise	O
these	O
exceptions	O
to	O
the	O
absolute	O
rules	O
of	O
the	O
market	O
economy	O
?	O

Regarding	O
the	O
first	O
point	O
,	O
we	O
say	O
quite	O
clearly	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
take	O
into	O
consideration	O
the	O
requirements	O
of	O
sustainable	O
development	O
which	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
has	O
endorsed	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
essential	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
instances	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
state	O
aid	O
to	O
businesses	O
,	O
be	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
tax	O
exemptions	O
,	O
special	O
taxation	O
or	O
even	O
direct	O
aid	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
legitimate	O
for	O
there	O
to	O
be	O
inter-company	O
agreements	O
and	O
voluntary	O
restraint	O
agreements	O
,	O
since	O
all	O
these	O
agreements	O
make	O
it	O
possible	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
detrimental	O
effects	O
of	O
competition	O
on	O
social	O
or	O
ecological	O
requirements	O
.	O

So	O
our	O
clear	O
response	O
is	O
that	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
such	O
aid	O
and	O
such	O
agreements	O
are	O
legitimate	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
say	O
that	O
every	O
single	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
agreements	O
must	O
be	O
expressly	O
justified	O
.	O

The	O

referring	O
supervision	O
of	O

legitimacy	O
of	O
individual	O
cases	O

national	O
level	O

We	O
feel	O
this	O
is	O
relatively	O
dangerous	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
same	O
we	O
shall	O
vote	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
it	O
because	O
we	O
recognise	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
cannot	O
do	O
everything	O

We	O
demand	O
that	O
the	O
greatest	O
possible	O
transparency	O
should	O
be	O
in	O
place	O
and	O
that	O
greater	O
powers	O
of	O
investigation	O
be	O
granted	O
to	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG

to	O

Mr	O

we	O

a	O

we	O

we	O
should	O
heed	O
the	O
words	O
of	O
von	B-PER

doubtless	O
also	O
those	O
of	O
the	O

I	O

quite	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
constraints	O
imposed	O
by	O

but	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O

it	O
must	O
be	O
emphasised	O
once	O
again	O
that	O
the	O
European	B-MISC
economy	O
is	O
finding	O
it	O
hard	O
to	O
compete	O
with	O
the	O
American	B-MISC
economy	O
,	O
especially	O
because	O
of	O
insufficiently	O
open	O
markets	O
and	O
a	O
lack	O
of	O
genuine	O
competition	O
.	O

What	O
is	O
being	O
done	O
may	O
well	O
be	O
very	O
important	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
not	O
sufficient	O
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
holding	O
a	O
special	O

This	O

because	O
it	O

that	O

But	O
,	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
understandable	O
because	O

I	O
share	O

a	O
thorough	O
manner	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
my	O
concerns	O
and	O
questions	O
nevertheless	O
.	O

Firstly	O
,	O
these	O
relate	O
to	O
the	O
coherence	O
of	O
the	O
policy	O
'	O
s	O
application	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
still	O
wonder	O
if	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
run	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
ending	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
Echternach	B-LOC

we	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
one	O
step	O

before	O
we	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
take	O
two	O
steps	O
forward	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
hear	O
more	O
about	O
how	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
will	O
guarantee	O
this	O
uniform	O
application	O
in	O
practice	O
and	O
whether	O
you	O
yourself	O
consider	O
the	O
courses	O
outlined	O
from	O
point	O
one	O
hundred	O
onwards	O
in	O
the	O
White	O
Paper	O
to	O
be	O
feasible	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
I	O
understand	O
the	O
worry	O
of	O
industry	O
regarding	O
legal	O
certainty	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
White	O
Paper	O
,	O
you	O
state	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
will	O
still	O
issue	O
particular	O
orders	O
which	O
can	O
be	O
used	O
as	O
guidelines	O
,	O
but	O
what	O
will	O
your	O
criteria	O
be	O
for	O
granting	O
such	O
orders	O
one	O
day	O
but	O
not	O
the	O
next	O
?	O

Thirdly	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
know	O
whether	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
has	O
looked	O
into	O
the	O
effects	O
its	O
new	O
approach	O
will	O
have	O
on	O
industrial	O
strategy	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
particular	O
concerns	O
regarding	O
the	O
fate	O
of	O
SMEs	O
which	O
will	O
lose	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
legal	O
and	O
financial	O
protection	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
already	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
one	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
admit	O
,	O
within	O
the	O
new	O
vertical	O
group	O
exemption	O
for	O
the	O
distribution	O
sector	O
.	O

Fourthly	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
informed	O
of	O
why	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
does	O
not	O
choose	O
to	O
apply	O
the	O
invalidity	O
penalty	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
evident	O
infringements	O
of	O
the	O
competition	O
rules	O

Fifthly	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
pending	O
enlargement	O
,	O
I	O
wonder	O
whether	O
the	O
candidate	O
counties	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
play	O
our	O
game	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
still	O
in	O
training	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
.	O

What	O
guarantees	O
do	O
we	O
have	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
grow	O
into	O
first-class	O
players	O
in	O
the	O
league	O
of	O
the	O
internal	O
market	O
?	O

Sixthly	O
and	O
lastly	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
remind	O
you	O
of	O
a	O
point	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
raised	O
in	O
my	O
report	O
on	O
vertical	O
restrictions	O
,	O
namely	O
the	O
legal	O
privilege	O
of	O
company	O
lawyers	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
implements	O
the	O
White	O
Paper	O
objectives	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
discrimination	O
within	O
the	O
internal	O
market	O
and	O
between	O
external	O
and	O
internal	O
legal	O
advisers	O
will	O
become	O
more	O
pronounced	O
and	O
hence	O
even	O
less	O
acceptable	O
.	O

Is	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
considering	O
taking	O
any	O
action	O
to	O
allow	O
in-house	O
lawyers	O
in	O
all	O
Member	B-ORG
States	I-ORG
legal	O
privilege	O
?	O

Commissioner	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
asking	O
these	O
questions	O
as	O
a	O
defender	O
of	O
the	O
internal	O
market	O
and	O
I	O
hope	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
this	O

we	O

Mr	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
,	O
in	O
beginning	O
my	O
speech	O

the	O
White	O

The	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
Group	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
the	I-ORG
Party	I-ORG
of	I-ORG
European	I-ORG
Socialists	I-ORG
is	O
very	O
much	O
in	O
agreement	O
with	O
your	O
report	O
is	O
clearly	O
demonstrated	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
only	O
one	O
amendment	O
has	O
been	O
presented	O
during	O
this	O
procedure	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
in	O
agreement	O
with	O
the	O
report	O
,	O
Commissioner	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
broad	O
outlines	O
of	O
the	O
White	O
Paper	O

Since	O
the	O
Treaty	B-MISC
entered	O
into	O
force	O
,	O
Community	B-MISC
law	I-MISC
on	I-MISC
competition	I-MISC
has	O
been	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
tenets	O
of	O
Community	B-MISC
policy	I-MISC
.	O

After	O
almost	O
forty	O
years	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
force	O
,	O
these	O
rules	O
were	O
beginning	O
to	O
show	O
signs	O
of	O
exhaustion	O

The	O
system	O
of	O
individual	O

needed	O
urgent	O
reform	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
unanimously	O
requested	O
by	O
specialised	O
companies	O
,	O
academics	O
and	O
lawyers	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
attended	O
a	O
single	O
forum	O
of	O
specialists	O
in	O
competition	O
law	O
which	O
has	O
not	O
requested	O
a	O
change	O
to	O
the	O
system	O

A	O
system	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
current	O
one	O

which	O
is	O
capable	O
of	O
making	O
so	O
few	O

be	O
they	O

is	O
something	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
valid	O
system	O

National	O
competition	O
authorities	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
apply	O
Articles	O
81	O
(	O

)	O
and	O
82	O
for	O
some	O
time	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
apply	O
Article	O
81	O
(	O

,	O
which	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
extent	O

prevented	O
the	O

application	O
of	O
Article	O

You	O
will	O
know	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
currently	O
two	O
preliminary	O
issues	O
before	O
the	O
Court	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
Justice	I-ORG
,	O
both	O
brought	O
by	O
German	B-MISC
courts	O
,	O
which	O
question	O
the	O
feasibility	O
of	O
applying	O

A	O
reform	O
of	O
this	O
point	O
was	O
therefore	O
also	O
necessary	O
.	O

The	O
procedure	O
in	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
competition	O
is	O
basically	O
contained	O
in	O
Regulation	O
1762	O
.	O

The	O
voices	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
its	O
amendment	O
were	O
unanimous	O
.	O

The	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
establish	O
a	O
genuine	O
procedure	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
establish	O
time	O
limits	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
regulate	O
access	O
for	O
interested	O
parties	O
to	O
the	O
files	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
defence	O
was	O
not	O
properly	O
recognised	O
,	O
were	O
factors	O
which	O
led	O
to	O
the	O
unanimous	O
demand	O
for	O
reform	O
.	O

The	O
Court	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
Justice	I-ORG
accepted	O
some	O
time	O
ago	O
that	O
Community	B-MISC
competition	I-MISC
law	I-MISC
could	O
be	O
applied	O
by	O
the	O
legal	O
bodies	O
of	O
the	O
Member	B-ORG
States	I-ORG
and	O
in	O
1994	O
,	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
published	O
a	O
communication	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
therefore	O
necessary	O
to	O
facilitate	O
this	O
approach	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
frequent	O
criticisms	O
of	O
Community	B-MISC
competition	I-MISC
law	I-MISC
is	O
its	O
excessive	O
red	O
tape	O
.	O

As	O
a	O
consequence	O
of	O
the	O
continental	O
legal	O
tradition	O
,	O
consideration	O
of	O
whether	O
certain	O
agreements	O
are	O
anti-competitive	O
or	O
not	O
depends	O
more	O
on	O
an	O
analysis	O
of	O
their	O
clauses	O
than	O
on	O
their	O
effects	O
on	O
the	O
market	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
therefore	O
necessary	O
to	O
introduce	O
an	O
economic	O
analysis	O
.	O

The	O
White	O
Paper	O
intends	O
to	O
resolve	O
these	O
problems	O
and	O
we	O
therefore	O
support	O
these	O
proposals	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
true	O
that	O
we	O
note	O
certain	O
deficiencies	O
which	O
have	O
come	O
to	O
light	O
in	O
the	O
report	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
Regulation	O
1762	O
must	O
be	O
repealed	O
and	O
replaced	O
with	O
a	O
new	O
regulation	O
.	O

For	O
these	O
reasons	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
vote	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
the	O
report	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
if	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
amendments	O
are	O
accepted	O
,	O
particularly	O
those	O
presented	O
by	O
the	O
PPE-DE	B-ORG
Group	I-ORG
,	O
we	O
would	O
consider	O
the	O
report	O
to	O
be	O
stripped	O
of	O
its	O
value	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
become	O
an	O
inconsistent	O
document	O
,	O
lacking	O
in	O
rigour	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
event	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
reconsider	O
our	O
support	O
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
amongst	O
the	O
various	O
issues	O
being	O
dealt	O
with	O
in	O
this	O
joint	O
debate	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
comment	O
on	O
the	O
one	O
mentioned	O
by	O
Mr	O
Berenguer	B-PER
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
the	O
modernisation	O
of	O
competition	B-MISC
policy	I-MISC
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
'	O
s	O
White	O
Paper	O
.	O

Frankly	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
modernisation	O
has	O
been	O
satisfactory	O
.	O

If	O
it	O
functions	O
well	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
satisfied	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
has	O
basically	O
acted	O
correctly	O
,	O
why	O
the	O
need	O
for	O
the	O
modification	O
?	O

Various	O
arguments	O
have	O
been	O
presented	O
in	O
its	O
favour	O
.	O

Mr	O
Berenguer	B-PER
made	O
a	O
very	O
accurate	O
analysis	O
,	O
justifying	O
the	O
need	O
and	O
the	O
relevant	O
reforms	O
for	O
improving	O
the	O
dynamics	O
of	O
competition	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
concern	O
is	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
standards	O
and	O
criteria	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
applied	O
through	O
the	O
corresponding	O
administrations	O
in	O
the	O
Member	B-ORG
States	I-ORG
,	O
are	O
truly	O
identical	O
in	O
all	O
regions	O
.	O

Because	O
,	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
be	O
faced	O
with	O
the	O
paradox	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
itself	O
will	O
introduce	O
elements	O
of	O
unfair	O
competition	O
into	O
the	O
functioning	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-MISC
internal	O
market	O
.	O

In	O
that	O
event	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
moved	O
forward	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
backwards	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
application	O
of	O
competition	B-MISC
policy	I-MISC
in	O
the	O
Union	B-ORG
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
firstly	O
to	O
express	O
my	O
appreciation	O
to	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
for	O
the	O
improvement	O
represented	O
by	O
the	O
XXVIIIth	B-MISC
report	I-MISC
on	I-MISC
competition	I-MISC
policy	I-MISC
in	I-MISC
the	I-MISC
Union	I-MISC
,	O
when	O
compared	O
to	O
previous	O
reports	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
also	O
like	O
to	O
highlight	O
the	O
work	O
carried	O
out	O
by	O
the	O
rapporteur	O
,	O
Mr	O
Rapkay	B-PER
,	O
who	O
has	O
dissected	O
this	O
dense	O
and	O
comprehensive	O
text	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
concise	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
also	O
like	O
to	O
fully	O
support	O
his	O
comments	O
on	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
allow	O
the	O
regions	O
-	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
Basque	B-LOC
Country	I-LOC
,	O
which	O
I	O
represent	O
-	O
a	O
margin	O
for	O
action	O
,	O
by	O
virtue	O
of	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
subsidiarity	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
guarantee	O
has	O
been	O
to	O
seek	O
prior	O
favourable	O
approval	O
,	O
through	O
individual	O
cases	O
,	O
which	O
will	O
take	O
more	O
than	O
six	O
or	O
eight	O
months	O
to	O
resolve	O
,	O
an	O
excessively	O
long	O
period	O
,	O
which	O
simply	O
leads	O
to	O
problems	O
of	O
a	O
lack	O
of	O
flexibility	O
,	O
affecting	O
the	O
generation	O
of	O
wealth	O
and	O
employment	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
believe	O
that	O
something	O
is	O
missing	O
and	O
I	O
suggest	O
that	O
we	O
establish	O
more	O
regulations	O
,	O
lay	O
down	O
clear	O
rules	O
,	O
which	O
will	O
benefit	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
:	O
businesspeople	O
,	O
investors	O
,	O
workers	O
and	O
the	O
citizens	O
in	O
general	O
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
stress	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
an	O
age	O
of	O
significant	O
technological	O
changes	O
-	O
just	O
look	O
at	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
in	O
the	O
information	O
technology	O
sector	O
and	O
other	O
sectors	O
such	O
as	O
energy	O
and	O
transport	O
-	O
safeguarding	O
competition	O
will	O
be	O
of	O
fundamental	O
importance	O
for	O
our	O
future	O
.	O

From	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
of	O
economic	O
growth	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
of	O
increasing	O
employment	O
and	O
wealth	O
,	O
safeguarding	O
a	O
competition	O
policy	O
in	O
the	O
Member	B-ORG
States	I-ORG
is	O
becoming	O
a	O
crucial	O
factor	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
that	O
is	O
certainly	O
very	O
important	O
for	O
our	O
future	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
give	O
this	O
report	O
my	O
full	O
support	O
.	O

Recently	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
has	O
been	O
working	O
hard	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
this	O
principal	O
is	O
respected	O
in	O
a	O
proper	O
and	O
effective	O
manner	O
,	O
precisely	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
safeguard	O
market	O
flexibility	O
,	O
both	O
for	O
products	O
and	O
for	O
services	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
emphasise	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
extremely	O
important	O
for	O
our	O
future	O
,	O
for	O
Europe	B-LOC
'	O
s	O
economy	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
above	O
all	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
our	O
wealth	O
and	O
technological	O
development	O
in	O
Europe	B-LOC
in	O
general	O
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
for	O
British	B-ORG
Conservatives	I-ORG
the	O
efficient	O
and	O
uniform	O
application	O
of	O
European	B-MISC
competition	I-MISC
policy	I-MISC
is	O
at	O
the	O
core	O
of	O
achieving	O
an	O
effective	O
single	O
market	O
across	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Union	I-ORG
.	O

During	O
my	O
six	O
months	O
as	O
a	O
Member	O
of	O
this	O
Parliament	B-ORG
,	O
I	O
have	O
become	O
acutely	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
determination	O
of	O
many	O
Members	O
to	O
drive	O
forward	O
what	O
is	O
described	O
as	O
the	O
European	B-MISC
project	I-MISC
.	O

We	O
daily	O
hear	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
promote	O
a	O
wider	O
and	O
deeper	O
Europe	B-LOC
.	O

But	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
in	O
effect	O
,	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
rhetoric	O
when	O
we	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
national	O
,	O
regional	O
and	O
local	O
obstacles	O
which	O
continue	O
to	O
block	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
a	O
true	O
European	B-MISC
single	O
market	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
the	O
context	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
consider	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
's	O
proposals	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
would	O
recognise	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
everybody	O
else	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
consider	O
his	O
particular	O
proposals	O
and	O
subject	O
them	O
to	O
rigorous	O
examination	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
done	O
by	O
our	O
rapporteur	O
on	O
the	O
Committee	B-ORG
for	I-ORG
Economic	I-ORG
and	I-ORG
Monetary	I-ORG
Affairs	I-ORG
,	O
Mr	O
von	B-PER
Wogau	I-PER
.	O

I	O
want	O
to	O
congratulate	O
him	O
,	O
sadly	O
in	O
his	O
absence	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
thorough	O
and	O
rigorous	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
has	O
undertaken	O
the	O
preparation	O
of	O
his	O
report	O
-	O
and	O
also	O
for	O
putting	O
up	O
with	O
my	O
being	O
such	O
a	O
thorn	O
in	O
his	O
side	O
!	O

He	O
mentioned	O
earlier	O
that	O
the	O
report	O
was	O
carried	O
with	O
a	O
significant	O
majority	O
but	O
not	O
with	O
my	O
support	O
.	O

So	O
although	O
I	O
may	O
not	O
share	O
his	O
conclusions	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
he	O
has	O
illustrated	O
in	O
his	O
report	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
issues	O
which	O
the	O
Commission	O
must	O
address	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
is	O
the	O
potential	O
for	O
renationalisation	O
of	O
competition	O
policy	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	O
is	O
set	O
against	O
this	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
potential	O
exists	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
Commissioner	O
Monti	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
what	O
happens	O
if	O
he	O
proves	O
to	O
be	O
wrong	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
effective	O
renationalisation	O
.	O

We	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
European	O
Court	O
is	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
provide	O
us	O
with	O
interim	O
measures	O
in	O
a	O
certain	O
dispute	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
with	O
France	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
the	O
Commission	O
.	O

I	O
ask	O
the	O
Commission	O
what	O
can	O

I	O
must	O
declare	O
an	O
interest	O
as	O
a	O
lawyer	O
but	O
also	O
as	O
a	O
former	O
competition	O
minister	O
in	O
the	O
United	O

We	O
all	O
have	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
our	O
histories	O
to	O
live	O
with	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
business	O
has	O
legal	O
certainty	O

I	O
would	O
also	O
ask	O
the	O
Commission	B-ORG
whether	O
an	O
analysis	O
has	O
been	O
undertaken	O
of	O
the	O
implications	O
of	O
this	O

a	O
cost-benefit	O
analysis	O
of	O
the	O
sort	O
that	O
is	O
now	O
becoming	O
so	O
much	O
more	O
European	B-MISC

But	O
I	O
really	O
feel	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
circumstances	O

we	O
want	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
implications	O
would	O
be	O

Finally	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
as	O
British	B-ORG

,	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
change	O
in	O
direction	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
an	O
independent	O
competition	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
hear	O
what	O
Commissioner	O
Monti	B-PER
has	O
to	O
say	O
about	O
that	O
.	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
the	O
European	B-MISC
Union	I-MISC
'	I-MISC
s	I-MISC
competition	I-MISC
policy	I-MISC
has	O
been	O
of	O
central	O
importance	O
since	O
European	B-MISC
integration	O
began	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
therefore	O
with	O
some	O
justification	O
that	O
competition	O
policy	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
policies	O
.	O

We	O
can	O
be	O
proud	O
of	O
a	O
European	B-MISC
competition	O
culture	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
this	O
that	O
will	O
make	O
the	O
social	O
market	O
economy	O
a	O
reality	O
.	O

We	O
can	O
be	O
proud	O
of	O
monopolies	O
and	O
mergers	O
supervision	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
be	O
vigilant	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
global	O
operators	O
,	O
against	O
whom	O
nation-states	O
are	O
no	O
longer	O
able	O
to	O
impose	O
limits	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
we	O
should	O
bear	O
in	O
mind	O
what	O
was	O
said	O
by	O
the	O
French	B-MISC
writer	O
Vivienne	B-PER
Forestier	I-PER
,	O
who	O
described	O
the	O
state	O
of	O

in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	O
economy	O
'	O
s	O
reign	O

.	O

European	B-MISC
competition	I-MISC
policy	I-MISC
,	O
as	O
we	O
very	O
often	O
forget	O
,	O
is	O
not	O
just	O
important	O
for	O
fair	O
competition	O
as	O
such	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
for	O
prices	O
,	O
growth	O
and	O
employment	O
,	O
and	O
hence	O
for	O
the	O
public	O
.	O

In	O
common	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
Members	O
,	O
I	O
call	O
for	O
Parliament	B-ORG
to	O
have	O
codecision	O
rights	O
where	O
competition	O
law	O
is	O
concerned	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
essential	O
that	O
this	O
long	O
overdue	O
step	O
be	O
taken	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
important	O
to	O
underline	O
the	O
connection	O
between	O
competition	O
policy	O
and	O
consumer	O
protection	O
.	O

I	O
welcome	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Commissioner	O
Monti	B-PER
wants	O
to	O
make	O
progress	O
in	O
this	O
area	O
in	O
the	O
dialogue	O
with	O
the	O
European	B-ORG
Parliament	I-ORG
,	O
as	O
he	O
does	O
in	O
the	O
dialogue	O
with	O
non-governmental	O
organisations	O
,	O
consumer	O
protection	O
associations	O
and	O
the	O

Greater	O

will	O
also	O
help	O
to	O
achieve	O
public	O
acceptance	O
of	O
decisions	O
relating	O
to	O
competition	O

Then	O
it	O
is	O
possible	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
lower	O
electricity	O

telecommunications	O
prices	O
are	O
due	O
to	O
European	B-MISC

Brussels	B-LOC
should	O
not	O

at	O
a	O

moment	O
in	O

in	O
a	O

It	O
is	O
particularly	O
important	O
for	O

clarity	O
in	O

to	O

rules	O
in	O

Emphasis	O
must	O
also	O
be	O
placed	O
on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
a	O
state	O
aid	O
policy	O
-	O
and	O
the	O
Jonckheer	B-MISC

makes	O
this	O
very	O
clear	O

must	O
continue	O
to	O

the	O
tasks	O
of	O

on	O
an	O

basis	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
made	O
clear	O
that	O
aid	O
can	O
serve	O
a	O
useful	O
purpose	O

with	O
a	O
view	O
to	O

I	O

of	O
this	O
House	B-ORG
and	O
indeed	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
my	O

because	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
competition	O

terms	O
,	O
the	O
directly	O
applicable	O
exception	O
system	O
is	O
in	O

to	O
a	O
system	O
of	O
prohibition	O
unless	O

and	O
I	O
believe	O
there	O

The	O

Mr	O
President	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
glad	O
that	O
Mrs	O
Randzio-Plath	B-PER
mentioned	O
the	O
very	O
important	O
context	O
of	O
our	O
debate	O
because	O
up	O
until	O
now	O
no	O
other	O
speaker	O
has	O
done	O
so	O
.	O

The	O
advent	O
of	O
the	O
euro	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
last	O
year	O
unleashed	O
enormous	O
competitive	O
forces	O
within	O
European	B-MISC
business	O
which	O
are	O
being	O
met	O
by	O
a	O
merger	O
wave	O
of	O
quite	O
unprecedented	O
proportions	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
the	O
figures	O
for	O
last	O
year	O
now	O
show	O
that	O
the	O
total	O
value	O
of	O
mergers	O
in	O
the	O
European	B-LOC
area	I-LOC
was	O
EUR	O
1.4	O
trillion	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
seven	O
times	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
merger	O
activity	O
at	O
the	O
peak	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
European	B-MISC
merger	O
boom	O
in	O
1990	O
.	O

This	O
poses	O
enormous	O
challenges	O
for	O
competition	O
policy	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
hope	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
meet	O
because	O
,	O
for	O
certain	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
those	O
mergers	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
designed	O
to	O
protect	O
profit	O
margins	O
of	O
the	O
businesses	O
from	O
competition	O
rather	O
than	O
merely	O
to	O
enhance	O
productivity	O
and	O
make	O
those	O
businesses	O
able	O
to	O
operate	O
on	O
a	O
bigger	O
scale	O

Commissioner	O
Monti	B-PER
and	O
his	O
colleagues	O
have	O
a	O
tremendous	O
challenge	O
ahead	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
our	O
worries	O
in	O
the	O
ELDR	B-MISC

are	O
that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
no	O
weakening	O
in	O
the	O
thrust	O
of	O

either	O
in	O
the	O
examination	O

the	O

Delegation	O
to	O
national	O

is	O
all	O
very	O
well	O
but	O
we	O
would	O
emphasise	O
what	O
Mr	O
von	B-PER
Wogau	I-PER
said	O
in	O
his	O
report	O
on	O
the	O
need	O
for	O
regular	O

national	O
authorities	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
slippage	O
in	O
the	O
European	B-MISC
element	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
particularly	O
would	O
ask	O
the	O
Commissioner	O
to	O
reassure	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
random	O
checks	O
on	O
that	O

Mr	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
would	O

express	O
my	O
support	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
carried	O
out	O
by	O
all	O
the	O

my	O
agreement	O

of	O

been	O
said	O
here	O

I	O

any	O

Mr	O

competition	O
is	O
exactly	O
what	O
we	O

In	O

we	O

I	O

very	O
